## What if Magic Had Two More Elements?

Have you ever wondered what a world of magic would look like if it had more than just the usual elemental forces? Imagine a reality where two mysterious substances shape the very fabric of existence—one an ethereal force of pure energy, the other a solid, enigmatic mineral that repels it.

In the world of **OpenFantasy**, these two elements redefine magic as we know it:

- [**Aeromana**](/codex/01_Basic/Aeromana.md) – A gaseous, omnipresent magical essence that flows through the world, powering spells, enchanting objects, and fueling the greatest arcane wonders.
- [**Exanthis**](/codex/01_Basic/Exanthis.md) – A rare and dense mineral that disrupts **Aeromana**, creating zones where magic falters, warps, or ceases entirely.

These two forces exist in constant opposition, shaping civilizations, battles, and the very laws of magic.
