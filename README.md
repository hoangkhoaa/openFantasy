## What if Magic Had Two More Elements?

Have you ever wondered what a world of magic would look like if it had more than just the usual elemental forces? Imagine a reality where two mysterious substances shape the very fabric of existence—one an ethereal force of pure energy, the other a solid, enigmatic mineral that repels it.

In the world of OpenFantasy, these two elements redefine magic as we know it:

- **Aeromana** – A gaseous, omnipresent magical essence that flows through the world, powering spells, enchanting objects, and fueling the greatest arcane wonders.
- **Exanthis** – A rare and dense mineral that disrupts Aeromana, creating zones where magic falters, warps, or ceases entirely.

These two forces exist in constant opposition, shaping civilizations, battles, and the very laws of magic.
