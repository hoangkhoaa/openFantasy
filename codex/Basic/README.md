# OpenFantasy Fundamental Concepts

> *"Three elements form the foundation of all existence: Exanthis gives it form, Soul gives it purpose, and Mana gives it wonder."*

## Overview

Welcome to the OpenFantasy Fundamental Concepts documentation. This section contains detailed information about the three foundational elements that define the reality of the OpenFantasy world: Exanthis, Soul, and Mana. These elements interact to create all beings, objects, and phenomena in the world.

## The Three Elements

Each of the three fundamental elements governs a different aspect of existence:

| Element | Nature | Function | Document |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | Physical, magnetic material | Creates form and structure | [Exanthis.md](Exanthis.md) |
| **Soul** | Ethereal essence | Provides consciousness and will | [Soul.md](Soul.md) |
| **Mana** | Magical energy | Enables magical manipulation | [Mana.md](Mana.md) |

## Exanthis

Exanthis is the foundation of physical reality, providing structure and solidity to the world:

### Key Properties

- Forms the physical structure of reality
- Generates magnetic fields that disrupt Mana
- At 100% purity, becomes the hardest known material
- Found in high concentrations in western regions

### Significance

Exanthis grounds reality in material form, providing resistance to magical forces and establishing the physical laws of the world. Higher Exanthis concentration in living beings grants them greater physical strength and durability at the cost of magical potential.

## Soul

The Soul bridges the material and spiritual realms, providing consciousness and will:

### Key Properties

- Consists of Core Identity, Memory Matrix, and Intent Framework
- Serves as the conduit for magical manipulation
- Can evolve and develop throughout a lifetime
- Persists after physical death

### Significance

The Soul enables beings to experience the world, form intentions, and manipulate Mana according to their will. It creates the unique identity of each individual and allows for conscious interaction with reality.

## Mana

Mana is the breath of creation itself, forming the foundation of all magical effects:

### Key Properties

- Permeates all things as particle-like energy
- Flows in currents throughout the world
- Resonates with Soul to enable magical manipulation
- Repelled by Exanthis' magnetic field

### Significance

Mana is the raw material of magic, enabling the transformation of intention into reality. It flows through the world in varying concentrations, creating regions of high and low magical potential.

## Elemental Interactions

The three elements interact in complex ways that define the nature of reality:

### Balance and Opposition

| Interaction | Result | Effect |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Exanthis + Mana** | Opposition | Exanthis disrupts and repels Mana |
| **Soul + Mana** | Harmony | Soul directs and shapes Mana |
| **Exanthis + Soul** | Structure | Soul animates physical form created by Exanthis |
| **All Three** | Balance | Creates living beings with unique capabilities |

### In Living Beings

The ratio of these elements in a living being determines their nature and abilities:

- **High Exanthis**: Greater physical strength and durability, reduced magical ability
- **High Soul**: Enhanced consciousness and willpower, often shorter lifespan
- **High Mana Capacity**: Enhanced magical potential, often reduced physical robustness

## Geographical Distribution

The elements are not evenly distributed throughout the world:

| Region | Dominant Element | Characteristics |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Eastern Veldrassil** | Mana | High magical potential, centers of arcane study |
| **Western Veldrassil** | Exanthis | Low magical potential, centers of physical industry |
| **Various Leylines** | Mana | Streams of concentrated magical energy |
| **Sacred Groves** | Soul | Places of heightened spiritual connection |

This uneven distribution creates natural zones of magical intensity and magical dead zones, influencing the development of civilizations and the distribution of species.
