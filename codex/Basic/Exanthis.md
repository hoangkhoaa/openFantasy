# **Exanthis**: The Foundation of Reality

[**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md) is a fundamental material that forms the bedrock of physical reality, providing structure and solidity to the world. Like the resonant body of a musical instrument, **Exanthis** gives form to the ephemeral vibrations of magic, transforming potential into tangible reality.

## Properties and Interaction

**Exanthis** generates a magnetic field that dances in harmony with the natural order, disrupting the flow of [**Mana**](/codex/Basic/Mana.md) like a stone breaking the surface of a still pond. Depending on its purity, it exhibits varying degrees of hardness. At **100% purity**, it becomes the hardest known metal, with a crystalline structure reminiscent of diamonds, yet with metallic properties similar to steel or iron.

### Exanthis and Magic

The relationship between **Exanthis** and **Mana** is complex and reciprocal:

- **Exanthis** disrupts the flow of **Mana** through its natural magnetic field, creating zones where magic is weakened or nullified entirely.
- This disruption is proportional to the **Exanthis'** purity. Higher purity creates stronger anti-magical fields.
- The disruption is temporary, like capturing moonlight in a jar. While it suppresses **Mana**, it does not completely negate it. If the concentration or potency of **Mana** is overwhelming, it can overpower **Exanthis'** magnetic field, like a storm breaking through a dam.

## Geographic Distribution

**Exanthis** is most abundant in the **western regions** of **Veldrassil**, creating a natural gradient of magical potency across the continent. The highest concentrations are found in the **Iron Mountains**, where massive veins of **Exanthis** create zones nearly devoid of magic.

### Impact on Civilization

Regions rich in **Exanthis** tend to develop technological rather than magical innovations. The inhabitants of these areas often develop beliefs and societal structures that emphasize physical strength, endurance, and material craftsmanship over magical prowess.

The natural exclusion of **Mana** near **Exanthis** deposits creates safe havens for beings sensitive to magic, leading to specialized settlements and industries around these areas.

## Exanthis in Living Beings

All living beings contain varying amounts of **Exanthis** in their composition, influencing their physical form and magical capabilities:

- Higher **Exanthis** content provides greater physical strength, endurance, and resistance to magic.
- Lower **Exanthis** content allows for greater magical sensitivity and potential.
- The balance of **Exanthis** and **Mana Capacity** in a being determines their natural aptitudes and limitations, like the balance of strings and resonance chambers in a musical instrument determines its sound.

### Species Variations

Different species exhibit characteristic ranges of **Exanthis** content:

- **Dwarves** (50-70% Exanthis): Exceptionally sturdy and magic-resistant
- **Humans** (20-55% Exanthis): Versatile and adaptable
- **Elves** (5-25% Exanthis): Physically graceful but less robust
- **Fae** (2-10% Exanthis): Almost ethereal, with minimal physical substance

## Applications of Exanthis

### Technological Uses

- **Weapon and Armor Crafting**: Pure **Exanthis** creates unparalleled weapons and armor, resistant even to magical attacks.
- **Anti-Magic Devices**: Devices incorporating **Exanthis** can create zones where magic is suppressed or nullified.
- **Stabilization Technology**: **Exanthis** is used to ground and stabilize structures in magically volatile regions.

### Medical Applications

- **Magical Suppressants**: **Exanthis** dust is used in medicines to treat conditions caused by magical overexposure.
- **Grounding Therapy**: **Exanthis** touchstones help stabilize beings suffering from magical instability.
- **Physical Enhancement**: Carefully administered **Exanthis** treatments can enhance physical resilience.

Understanding **Exanthis** provides insight into the foundation of physical reality in the world of **OpenFantasy**, like knowing the materials from which a musical instrument is crafted. It creates the stable foundation upon which the world exists, allowing the symphony of creation to play out across its solid surface.
