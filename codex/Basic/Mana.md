## Nature and Properties

**Mana** is the breath of creation itself, atomic particles smaller than ordinary atoms that dance between the realms of possibility and reality. These particles possess several unique characteristics:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Form** | Ethereal, particle-like energy |
| **State** | Semi-gaseous, flowing like currents |
| **Visibility** | Invisible to normal sight, visible to magical perception |
| **Regeneration** | Self-replenishing within living beings at varied rates |
| **Composition** | Pure magical energy that can be refined into elemental forms |

## Mana and Soul

**Mana** resonates with the will of the [**Soul**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), allowing beings to shape reality through conscious intent:

- When a living being possesses a **Soul**, **Mana** particles attach to its **Soul framework**
- This creates a bridge between consciousness and creation
- The being can then wield **Mana**, shaping it through sheer will
- **Mana** regenerates naturally within a being's body at a rate determined by the **Soul's** innate capacity
- Beings can project their own **Mana** into the environment to harmonize with external energy

### Magical Potency

The effectiveness of magical workings depends on several factors:

- The density of **Mana** in the surroundings
- The purity of **Mana** being channeled
- The clarity of intent from the **Soul** directing it
- The absence of **Exanthis** interference

## Geographic Distribution

**Mana** is not evenly distributed throughout the world:

| Region | Mana Concentration | Notable Features |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Eastern Veldrassil** | Very High | Centers of magical study, intense magical phenomena |
| **Central Plains** | Moderate | Balanced magical environments, stable casting conditions |
| **Ley Lines** | Extremely High | Rivers of concentrated magical energy crossing the world |
| **Nexus Points** | Overwhelming | Intersections of multiple ley lines, often unstable |
| **Western Veldrassil** | Low to Very Low | Due to high **Exanthis** concentration |

### Movement Patterns

**Mana** flows through the world in currents similar to atmospheric winds:

- Creates regions of varying magical potency
- Shifts seasonally according to cosmic cycles
- Can be temporarily depleted by massive magical workings
- Naturally replenishes over time from cosmic sources

## Applications

The manipulation of **Mana** forms the basis for all magical practices:

### Magical Functions

- **Spellcasting**: Directed manipulation of reality through structured patterns
- **Enchantment**: Infusing objects with persistent magical properties
- **Divination**: Perceiving information beyond normal senses
- **Transmutation**: Altering the properties of physical matter
- **Conjuration**: Creating temporary manifestations of matter or energy

### Beyond Magic

**Mana** influences more than just magical effects:

- Enhances creativity and intuition in high-concentration regions
- Accelerates natural processes like growth and healing
- Creates natural phenomena like glowing flora or weather anomalies
- Attracts extradimensional entities drawn to its energy

## Interaction with Exanthis

**Mana** is repelled by the magnetic field of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md):

- Creates zones where magic is weakened or nullified
- Forms natural boundaries between high and low magical regions
- Produces unique phenomena at the interface between high **Mana** and high **Exanthis** areas
- Can be temporarily forced through **Exanthis** barriers with sufficient power

### Balance of Forces

The opposition between **Mana** and **Exanthis** creates a natural system of checks and balances:

- Prevents any single power from dominating the world
- Creates diverse environmental niches for different species
- Establishes natural boundaries between civilizations
- Forms the foundation for the world's magical ecology
