# **Mana**: The Ethereal Essence of Magic

**Mana** is the breath of creation itself, atomic particles smaller than ordinary atoms that dance between the realms of possibility and reality. These particles resonate with the will of the [**soul**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), allowing beings to shape reality through conscious intent.

**Mana** permeates all things, flowing like liquid starlight through the fabric of reality. When a living being possesses a **soul**, these particles attach to its **soul framework**, creating a bridge between consciousness and creation. This allows the being to wield **Mana**, shaping it through sheer will, like an artist painting with light itself. Additionally, **Mana** can regenerate naturally within a being's body at a rate determined by the **soul's** innate capacity at birth, like a well that refills according to its depth.

Beings can project their own **Mana** into the environment, harmonizing with external energy to amplify their magical power. The potency of a spell depends on the density of **Mana** in the surroundings, influencing both the strength of the magic and the rate at which a being's **mana** replenishes, like a musician playing in harmony with an orchestra.

The highest concentration of **Mana** is found in **eastern Veldrassil**, where the currents of magic flow most intensely, like a great river of light flowing through the land. These currents move in patterns similar to atmospheric winds, creating regions of varying magical potency across the world.

However, **Mana** is repelled by the magnetic field of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), creating zones where magic is weakened or nullified, like shadows cast by great mountains of light.

In addition to its magical properties, **Mana** influences the emotional and mental states of beings, often enhancing creativity and intuition. This makes regions rich in **Mana** centers of innovation and arcane study, where thoughts take flight on wings of possibility.

Regions with high concentrations of **Mana**, such as **eastern Veldrassil**, are often hubs of magical research and development. These areas attract **scholars**, **mages**, and **inventors** who seek to harness **Mana's** potential for technological and magical advancements, like moths drawn to a flame of infinite possibilities.
