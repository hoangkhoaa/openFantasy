# **Humans**: The Complex Weave of Exanthis, Souls, and Aeromana

[**Humans**](/codex/01_Creatures/Human.md) are formed from a physical body composed of various substances, including the mineral [**Exanthis**](/codex/01_Basic/Exanthis.md), a [**soul**](/codex/01_Basic/Soul.md) (also known as the **soul framework** due to its shape), and [**Aeromana**](/codex/01_Basic/Aeromana.md). The magnetic field of **Exanthis** within the body influences a human's **mana** capabilities, often limiting their potential.

## Composition and Potential

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/01_Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **humans** is **Exanthis** 40%, **Soul** 20%, **Aeromana** 40%. This balanced composition grants **humans** their characteristic adaptability but limits their magical and physical potential compared to other species.

### Variations in Human Composition

**Humans** with atypical ratios often develop specialized abilities:
- E 20%, S 20%, A 60%: Naturally gifted **mages**, though their potential depends on the overall strength of their components
- E 60%, S 20%, A 20%: Exceptional **warriors** or **scouts** with enhanced physical prowess and heightened senses

## Soul Decay and Forbidden Arts

The **soul decay** timeline for **humans**, from birth to complete decay, is approximately 100 years. Certain forbidden arts can alter the **soul** ratio to increase the other two components, but this can lead to uncontrolled decay, loss of consciousness, or transformation into a **beast**.

## Characteristics

**Humans** are known for their adaptability and resilience. They possess a unique balance of physical and magical potential, allowing them to excel in various fields, from combat to arcane studies.

## Habitat

**Humans** primarily inhabit the central and **western regions** of the world, where the balance of **Aeromana** and **Exanthis** allows for a harmonious existence. They are predominantly found along riverbanks, coastal areas, and near the **Great Dungeon**, providing them with strategic advantages for trade, exploration, and defense.

## Potential and Limitations

Despite their adaptability, **humans** have lower potential compared to other species due to their relatively high **soul** ratio of 20%. In contrast, **elves** (10%) and **beastfolk** (15%) can harness greater magical or physical abilities. However, the versatility and capacity for growth of **humans** often compensate for this limitation.

## Cultural Impact

In the world of **OpenFantasy**, **humans** play a crucial role in shaping the political and cultural landscapes. Their cities are centers of trade, diplomacy, and knowledge, often serving as the heart of civilization. The proximity to the **Great Dungeon** offers both opportunities and challenges, as **humans** frequently engage in expeditions to uncover its secrets and treasures.
