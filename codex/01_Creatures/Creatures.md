# Creatures of **OpenFantasy**: A Study of Ratios

In the world of **OpenFantasy**, each species is defined by a unique balance of [**Exanthis**](/codex/01_Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/01_Basic/Soul.md), and [**Aeromana**](/codex/01_Basic/Aeromana.md). These ratios determine their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

## Principles of Ratio Allocation

The general formula for strength in creatures consists of **Exanthis** (E), the **soul** (S), and **Aeromana** (A). Each species, and each individual within a species, has different ratios of these elements. These ratios are fixed and difficult to change, but the overall strength of a creature can increase over time.

A high E ratio enhances physical strength and sensory perception, granting special abilities. Similarly, a high A ratio allows for the use of spells requiring high purity. The soul ratio (S) influences the potential for growth and adaptability, but a high soul ratio can also limit overall power.

## Individual Variation

The balance of these elements influences not only their physical and magical capabilities but also their cultural and societal roles. Understanding these ratios provides insight into the strengths and limitations of each species in the world of **OpenFantasy**.
