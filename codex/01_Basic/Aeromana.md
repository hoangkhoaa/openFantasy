# Aeromana: The Ethereal Essence of Magic

Aeromana is a type of atomic particle, smaller than ordinary atoms, that resonates with the will of the soul. These particles exist throughout the world, though their concentration varies across different regions. Depending on its purity, Aeromana can transform into other elements or take on different elemental properties.

Aeromana permeates all things, and when a living being possesses a soul, these particles attach to its **soul framework**. This allows the being to wield Aeromana, shaping it through sheer will. Additionally, Aeromana can regenerate naturally within a being’s body at a rate determined by the soul’s innate capacity at birth.

Beings can project their own Aeromana into the environment, harmonizing with external energy to amplify their magical power. The potency of a spell depends on the density of Aeromana in the surroundings, influencing both the strength of the magic and the rate at which a being's mana replenishes.

The highest concentration of Aeromana is found in **eastern Veldrassil**, where the currents of magic flow most intensely. These currents move in patterns similar to atmospheric convection, though their cycles remain difficult to predict.

However, Aeromana is **repelled by the magnetic field of Exanthis**, a mineral that disrupts its flow, creating zones where magic is weakened or nullified.
