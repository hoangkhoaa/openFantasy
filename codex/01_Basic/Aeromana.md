# **Aeromana**: The Ethereal Essence of Magic

**Aeromana** is a type of atomic particle, smaller than ordinary atoms, that resonates with the will of the [**soul**](/codex/01_Basic/Soul.md). These particles exist throughout the world, though their concentration varies across different regions. Depending on its purity, **Aeromana** can transform into other elements or take on different elemental properties.

## Properties and Interaction

**Aeromana** permeates all things, and when a living being possesses a **soul**, these particles attach to its **soul framework**. This allows the being to wield **Aeromana**, shaping it through sheer will. Additionally, **Aeromana** can regenerate naturally within a being's body at a rate determined by the **soul's** innate capacity at birth.

Beings can project their own **Aeromana** into the environment, harmonizing with external energy to amplify their magical power. The potency of a spell depends on the density of **Aeromana** in the surroundings, influencing both the strength of the magic and the rate at which a being's **mana** replenishes.

## Geographic Distribution

The highest concentration of **Aeromana** is found in **eastern Veldrassil**, where the currents of magic flow most intensely. These currents move in patterns similar to atmospheric convection, though their cycles remain difficult to predict.

However, **Aeromana** is repelled by the magnetic field of [**Exanthis**](/codex/01_Basic/Exanthis.md), creating zones where magic is weakened or nullified.

## Impact on Life and Society

In addition to its magical properties, **Aeromana** influences the emotional and mental states of beings, often enhancing creativity and intuition. This makes regions rich in **Aeromana** centers of innovation and arcane study.

### Influence on Civilization

Regions with high concentrations of **Aeromana**, such as **eastern Veldrassil**, are often hubs of magical research and development. These areas attract **scholars**, **mages**, and **inventors** who seek to harness **Aeromana's** potential for technological and magical advancements.
