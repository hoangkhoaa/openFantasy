# **Exanthis**: The Essence of Vitality and Resistance

**Exanthis** consists of atomic structures larger than ordinary atoms, typically found in mineral form or dissolved within the bodies of living beings. Its fundamental nature enhances biological growth, fortifies physical strength, sharpens senses, and accelerates regeneration.

## Composition and Occurrence

This substance is most commonly concentrated in the **western regions**, scattered as ore deposits beneath the earth and within the bodies of living creatures. 

**Exanthis** generates a magnetic field capable of disrupting [**Aeromana**](/codex/01_Basic/Aeromana.md). Depending on its purity, it exhibits varying degrees of hardness. At **100% purity**, it becomes the hardest known metal, with a crystalline white quartz-like appearance.

Despite its hardness, **Exanthis** has a **lightweight structure**, is non-toxic, and remains chemically inert to most substances.

## Effects on Living Beings

Creatures that dwell in regions rich in **Exanthis** gradually absorb its magnetic field, developing natural **resistance to magic**. Over time, the concentration of **Exanthis** in their bodies enhances their physical attributes and further increases their resistance to magical effects. Conversely, **sorcerers** find themselves weakened in areas saturated with **Exanthis**.

## Practical Applications

Despite its valuable properties, **mining Exanthis is extremely challenging**. While it suppresses **Aeromana**, it does not completely negate it. If the concentration or potency of **Aeromana** is overwhelming, it can overpower **Exanthis'** magnetic field.

Due to its unique properties, **Exanthis** is highly sought after as a material for crafting **anti-magic weapons** and defenses against **sorcerers** and magical creatures.

**Exanthis** also has a symbiotic relationship with certain flora and fauna, enhancing their growth and resilience. This has led to the development of unique ecosystems in **Exanthis**-rich areas, where life forms exhibit extraordinary adaptations.

### Role in Society

**Exanthis** is highly valued for its ability to enhance physical capabilities and provide resistance to magic. It is often used in the crafting of weapons and armor, making it a crucial resource for **warriors** and **defenders**. The western regions, rich in **Exanthis**, are known for their strong and resilient inhabitants.
