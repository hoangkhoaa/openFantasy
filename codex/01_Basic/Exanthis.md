# Exanthis: The Essence of Vitality and Resistance

Exanthis consists of atomic structures larger than ordinary atoms, typically found in mineral form or dissolved within the bodies of living beings. Its fundamental nature enhances biological growth, fortifies physical strength, sharpens senses, and accelerates regeneration.

This substance is most commonly concentrated in the **western regions**, scattered as ore deposits beneath the earth and within the bodies of living creatures. 

Exanthis generates a magnetic field capable of disrupting Aeromana. Depending on its purity, it exhibits varying degrees of hardness. At **100% purity**, it becomes the hardest known metal, with a crystalline white quartz-like appearance.

Despite its hardness, Exanthis has a **lightweight structure**, is non-toxic, and remains chemically inert to most substances.

Creatures that dwell in regions rich in Exanthis gradually absorb its magnetic field, developing natural **resistance to magic**. Over time, the concentration of Exanthis in their bodies enhances their physical attributes and further increases their resistance to magical effects. Conversely, sorcerers find themselves weakened in areas saturated with Exanthis.

However, **mining Exanthis is extremely challenging**. While it suppresses Aeromana, it does not completely negate it. If the concentration or potency of Aeromana is overwhelming, it can overpower Exanthisâ€™ magnetic field.

Due to its unique properties, Exanthis is highly sought after as a material for crafting **anti-magic weapons** and defenses against sorcerers and magical creatures.
