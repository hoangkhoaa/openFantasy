# The Enigma of **Souls**

**Souls** are among the most enigmatic aspects of the magical world. They can be subtly influenced by the magnetic fields of [**Exanthis**](/codex/01_Basic/Exanthis.md) or by magic with a purity that resonates with the soul itself. However, all magic and research concerning **souls** are strictly forbidden.

## Nature and Composition

**Souls** possess a divisive nature. At birth, a **soul** gradually grows over time, maintaining a specific ratio for each species:
- [**Humans**](/codex/01_Creatures/Human.md): 20%
- [**Elves**](/codex/01_Creatures/Creatures.md#elves): 10%
- [**Beastfolk**](/codex/01_Creatures/Creatures.md#beastfolk): 15%
- [**Dwarves**](/codex/01_Creatures/Creatures.md#dwarves): 25%

It is believed that **souls** drift along the currents of **mana** or the magnetic fields of **Exanthis**, eventually coalescing into different soul variants, giving rise to various species.

## Decay and Regeneration

**Souls** naturally undergo decay, but this process halts at a certain threshold. Although [**humans**](/codex/01_Creatures/Human.md) have a high soul ratio, their **souls** tend to decay rapidly over approximately 100 years. The more a **soul** divides, the more willpower is lost.

Some individuals possess the ability to regenerate their **souls** through secret arts, allowing them to live for millennia and become revered as **saints**. Conversely, there are those who can absorb the **souls** of others or use forbidden magic, known as **demons**.

## After Death

Upon death, a **soul** escapes the body. If it harbors strong attachments or is imprisoned, its decay temporarily halts, resulting in the formation of ***ghosts***.
