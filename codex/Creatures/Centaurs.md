# **Centaurs**: The Swift Riders of the Plains

[**Centaurs**](/codex/Creatures/Centaurs.md) are the swift riders of the plains, their bodies a powerful harmony of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a galloping percussion section, they resonate with the rhythm of the land, creating a unique melody of existence that bridges the human and equine realms.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **centaurs** forms a harmony that favors physical prowess:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 50-70% | The crystalline heart that grants exceptional strength and speed |
| **Soul** | 20-30% | The ethereal essence that shapes a balanced and adaptable consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 10-25% | The bridge between worlds that enables limited magical potential |

This composition grants **centaurs** their characteristic speed and strength but typically limits their magical potential compared to other species, like a powerful instrument that can play with great intensity but lacks the subtlety of a full orchestra.

### Individual Variations

While the model composition represents the typical centaur, individual variations exist based on their clan lineage:

- **Wind Champions**: Some centaurs, particularly from the Windrider clan, possess Exanthis levels as high as 75%, giving them extraordinary speed and endurance that allows them to run for days without rest, though with reduced magical abilities (10% Mana Capacity).
- **Earth Seers**: Rarer centaurs with enhanced Mana Capacity (up to 30%) can manipulate earth magic with impressive skill, particularly for tracking, healing, and strengthening clan territories.
- **Star Prophets**: Those with higher Soul percentages (up to 35%) become wise leaders and prophets, often developing divination abilities based on celestial observations.
- **Forest Shadows**: A specialized variant with balanced composition (50% Exanthis, 25% Soul, 25% Mana Capacity) develops extraordinary stealth abilities despite their size, becoming master hunters and scouts.
- **Thunder Hooves**: Some centaurs develop a unique composition (65% Exanthis, 20% Soul, 15% Mana Capacity) that allows them to channel their physical energy into combat techniques that generate thunderous impacts with each strike.

## Physical Characteristics

**Centaurs** are known for their powerful build and equine grace:
- Humanoid upper bodies seamlessly joined to horse-like lower bodies
- Height ranging from 7 to 9 feet at the shoulder, depending on their lineage
- Muscular build with dense muscle and bone structure, like living embodiments of power
- Eyes that gleam with inner light, reflecting their connection to [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md)
- Hair and manes that are often intricately braided with symbols of clan and status
- Natural resistance to fatigue and endurance, like the endless plains they call home

## Physical and Magical Affinity

**Centaurs** demonstrate exceptional proficiency in speed and endurance, like virtuoso performers who excel in power and rhythm. Their composition allows them to:
- Develop extraordinary speed and stamina, like living embodiments of the wind
- Channel earth magic with minimal proficiency, particularly for navigation and tracking
- Resist magical effects through their high **Exanthis** content, like a stone breaking the surface of a magical pond

This power makes **centaurs** capable of achieving feats of speed and endurance that few other species can match, though they may struggle with tasks requiring complex magical abilities, like a powerful instrument that can play with great intensity but lacks the complexity of a full orchestra.

## Lifespan and Soul Decay

The **soul decay** timeline for **centaurs**, from birth to complete decay, is approximately 200 years, like a steady flame that illuminates the plains. This moderate lifespan allows them to:
- Accumulate knowledge and wisdom over generations
- Develop deep connections to their territories and traditions
- Form stable societies with strong hierarchical structures

However, their moderate soul ratio also means they change and adapt at a moderate pace, like a melody that evolves with the seasons.

## Habitat and Distribution

**Centaurs** primarily inhabit:
- Vast grasslands and plains, where they can run freely and hunt
- Rolling hills and savannas, where they can maintain their herds
- Strategic locations that provide access to water and resources
- Nomadic territories that allow them to follow the migrations of game

These locations provide ideal environments for the development of speed and the practice of earth magic, like stages perfectly suited to their performance.

- Martial prowess and hunting skills
- Earth magic and navigation
- Hierarchical structures and clan pride

The connection to the land has shaped centaur culture around respect for speed, strength, and tradition, creating a society where might and skill are highly valued.

## Relationship with Other Species

- With [**Humans**](/codex/Creatures/Human.md): A mixture of respect for their adaptability and frustration with their weakness
- With **Elves**: A wary respect, acknowledging their magical prowess but finding their ways strange
- With **Dwarves**: A pragmatic alliance based on mutual respect for strength and craftsmanship
