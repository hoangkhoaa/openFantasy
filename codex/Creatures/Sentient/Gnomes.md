# **Gnomes (侏儒)**: The Ingenious Crafters of Innovation (创新的巧妙工匠)

[**Gnomes (侏儒)**](/codex/Creatures/Gnomes.md) are the ingenious crafters of innovation (创新的巧妙工匠), their bodies a delicate harmony of [**Exanthis (埃克桑瑟斯)**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls (灵魂)**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity (法力容量)**. Like a complex music box (复杂的音乐盒), they resonate with the precision of machinery (机械的精准), creating a unique melody of existence (独特的存在旋律) that bridges the magical and technological realms (连接魔法与科技的领域).

## Elemental Composition (元素构成)

As detailed in [Creatures (生物)](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **gnomes (侏儒)** forms a harmony that favors adaptability (有利于适应性):
