[**Elves** (精灵)](/codex/Creatures/Elves.md) are the eternal seekers of wisdom (是永恒的智慧追寻者), their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis** (埃克桑提斯)](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls** (灵魂)](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity** (魔法容量). Like a flute that plays an endless melody (就像一首永无止境的笛声), they embody grace and magical prowess (他们体现了优雅和魔法力量), creating a unique harmony of existence that emphasizes longevity, knowledge, and magical mastery (创造了一种独特的和谐存在，强调长寿、知识和魔法掌握).
