[**Dwarves**](/codex/Creatures/Dwarves.md) are the steadfast guardians of tradition, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a bass drum that provides the foundation for an orchestra, they embody resilience and craftsmanship, creating a unique melody of existence that emphasizes durability, skill, and cultural continuity.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **dwarves** forms a harmony that favors physical resilience:

- **Rune Masters**: Rare individuals have Mana Capacity approaching 30%, allowing them to create powerful runic enchantments and artifacts, though they typically maintain significant physical resilience (45% Exanthis).
- **Balanced Dwarves**: Some maintain a more balanced composition (50% Exanthis, 25% Soul, 25% Mana Capacity), allowing them to adapt to various roles within dwarven society.
