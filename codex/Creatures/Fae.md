# **Fae**: The Ethereal Dancers of Magic

[**Fae**](/codex/Creatures/Fae.md) are the ethereal dancers of magic, their bodies a delicate harmony of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a shimmering harp, they resonate most strongly with the ethereal currents of [**Mana**](/codex/Basic/Mana.md), creating a unique melody of existence that bridges the material and spiritual realms.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **fae** forms a harmony that favors magical potential:

| Element | Range | Function |

| **Soul** | 15-35% | The ethereal essence that shapes a fluid and adaptable consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 50-80% | The bridge between worlds that enables extraordinary magical potential |

This composition grants **fae** their characteristic magical prowess but severely limits their physical resilience compared to other species, like a delicate instrument that produces beautiful sounds but must be handled with care.

### Individual Variations

While the model composition represents the typical fae, individual variations exist:

- **Arcane Fae**: Some fae possess Mana Capacity as high as 85%, making them among the most powerful spellcasters in existence, though physically fragile with as little as 5% Exanthis.

- **Dream Weavers**: Those with higher Soul percentages (up to 40%) develop exceptional abilities in manipulating consciousness and dreams, often becoming powerful enchanters or diplomatic emissaries.
- **Seasonal Fae**: Specialized fae with composition tailored to their court's season (e.g., Summer Court: 15% Exanthis, 25% Soul, 60% Mana Capacity; Winter Court: 20% Exanthis, 20% Soul, 60% Mana Capacity).
- **Twilight Dancers**: A unique composition of (10% Exanthis, 30% Soul, 60% Mana Capacity) creates fae who excel at manipulating the boundaries between worlds and realities.
