# Monsters of OpenFantasy

> *"Not all that walks beneath the moons is born of natural design. Some creatures emerge from darkness, corruption, or the fevered dreams of reality itself."*

## Overview

In OpenFantasy, "monsters" refers to dangerous or unnatural creatures that exist outside the normal ecological balance. Unlike animals that evolved through natural processes, monsters typically emerge through magical accidents, corruption, deliberate creation, or manifestation from other planes of existence.

Monsters often possess abilities that defy conventional understanding, making them particularly dangerous to sentient civilizations and natural ecosystems alike. While not universally malevolent, most pose significant threats due to their predatory nature, territorial aggression, or incompatibility with the natural world.

## Monster Origins

Monsters come into being through various means, each creating distinct types of creatures:

| Origin | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Corruption** | Natural beings twisted by dark magic or contamination | Blighted wolves, tainted elementals, plague beasts |
| **Magical Creation** | Deliberately crafted through spellcraft | Chimeras, artificial abominations, bound spirits |
| **Planar Intrusion** | Entities that enter from other planes of existence | Void stalkers, dream haunts, dimensional anomalies |
| **Ancient Evolution** | Primordial creatures from before current natural order | Deep terrors, prehistoric predators, living fossils |
| **Death Perversion** | Creatures formed through interference with natural death | Undead, soul-bound husks, necromantic constructs |
