### Skills

Skills are learned abilities that characters can use to perform specific tasks. The skill system is designed to be flexible. Each skill is associated with one of the core attributes. When attempting a skill check, the player rolls a d20, adds their skill bonus, and compares the result to a difficulty class (DC).

*   **Example:** Stealth (Ẩn nấp) (Dexterity (Sự khéo léo)): Used for moving silently and remaining hidden.

### Combat

Combat in OpenFantasy is turn-based.

*   **Attack Roll (Tung xúc xắc tấn công):** 1d20 + Attack Bonus (Điểm thưởng tấn công) vs. Armor Class (AC) (Lớp giáp)
*   **Damage (Sát thương):** Weapon Damage (Sát thương vũ khí) + Strength Modifier (Điểm bổ trợ sức mạnh)
