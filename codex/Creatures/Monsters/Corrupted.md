# OpenFantasy: A New Frontier in RPG Development

Welcome to OpenFantasy, a groundbreaking project aimed at creating a free, open-source, and customizable RPG (Role-Playing Game) engine. This document outlines the core principles, architecture, and goals of OpenFantasy.

## Core Principles

OpenFantasy is built upon the following principles:

*   **Open Source:** The entire codebase is available under a permissive license, encouraging community contributions and modifications.
*   **Customizable:** The engine is designed to be highly modular and extensible, allowing developers to create unique gameplay experiences.
*   **Cross-Platform:** OpenFantasy aims to support multiple platforms, including Windows (Windows), macOS (macOS), Linux (Linux), and web browsers.
*   **Data-Driven:** Game content is defined using data files, making it easy to create and modify game content without recompiling the engine.
*   **Community-Driven:** The development of OpenFantasy is driven by the community, with contributions from developers, artists, and game designers.

## Architecture

OpenFantasy's architecture is based on a modular design, with clear separation of concerns. The core components include:

*   **Core Engine:** Provides the fundamental functionality of the engine, such as rendering, input handling, and resource management.
*   **Scripting System:** Allows developers to write game logic using a scripting language (e.g., Lua (Lua)).
*   **Data System:** Manages the loading and processing of game data from data files.
*   **UI System:** Provides tools for creating user interfaces.
*   **Networking System:** Enables multiplayer gameplay.

## Data Format

OpenFantasy uses a custom data format based on JSON (JSON) for defining game content. This format is human-readable and easy to parse, making it ideal for data-driven development. Here's an example of a `character.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "Hero (Héroe)",
  "class": "Warrior (Guerrero)",
  "level": 1,
  "attributes": {
    "strength": 10,
    "agility": 8,
    "intelligence": 5
  }
}
```

## Example Table

Here's an example table showcasing different races and their attributes in OpenFantasy:

| Race (Raza)    | Strength (Fuerza) | Agility (Agilidad) | Intelligence (Inteligencia) |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Humans (Humanos)   | 10                | 10                 | 10                          |
| Elves (Elfos)    | 8                 | 12                 | 10                          |
| Dwarves (Enanos) | 12                | 8                  | 8                           |

*   Providing feedback and suggestions on the OpenFantasy forums (foros de OpenFantasy).
*   Reporting bugs and issues on the issue tracker (seguidor de problemas).

## Roadmap

The current roadmap for OpenFantasy includes the following milestones:
