## Overview

Mana Blights are dangerous manifestations of corrupted magical energy, occurring when Wild Mana becomes severely contaminated and unstable. Unlike [Mana Wisps](/codex/Creatures/Magical/ManaWisps.md), which represent the harmonious potential of magical energy, Blights embody magic's destructive capacity when left uncontrolled or deliberately corrupted. They form in areas of magical catastrophe, failed ritual sites, or places where the natural flow of magic has been severely disrupted. Constantly hungry for more energy to sustain their unstable existence, Blights represent one of the most significant hazards in areas of high magical activity.

## Elemental Composition

**Mana Blights** possess a dangerously imbalanced elemental composition:

| Exanthis | Soul | Mana Capacity | Representative Type |
|----------|------|---------------|---------------------|
| 15-25% | 0-5% | 70-85% | Standard Blight |
| 30-40% | 0-2% | 60-70% | **Crystalline Blight** with partial physical manifestation |
| 10-15% | 5-10% | 75-85% | **Sentient Blight** with rudimentary consciousness |
| 5-15% | 0-5% | 80-95% | **Void Blight** with extreme magical instability |

### Distinctive Composition

Unlike most creatures, Mana Blights possess a fundamentally unstable elemental balance. Their abnormally high Mana Capacity contains almost entirely unprocessed Wild Mana rather than Base Mana, creating a constantly fluctuating energy state. Their Exanthis component consists primarily of magical residue and environmental matter absorbed during formation rather than biological tissue. Most Blights possess negligible Soul components, though particularly old specimens may develop rudimentary consciousness through extended existence.

## Physical Characteristics

**Mana Blights** exhibit disturbing physical traits:

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Size** | Highly variable; typically 2-8 feet in diameter but can grow substantially larger |
| **Weight** | 30-200 pounds depending on absorbed material |
| **Lifespan** | Typically 1-5 years until energy dissolution or containment |
| **Physical Maturity** | Reach full power within 2-4 weeks of formation |
| **Notable Features** | Dark, swirling core with chaotic energy patterns and often incorporated environmental debris |

### Appearance

- **Anti-Luminescence**: Often absorb rather than emit light, creating shadow-like distortions
- **Unstable Boundaries**: Edges constantly shift and pulse with erratic energy discharges
- **Environmental Incorporation**: Absorb and integrate nearby materials into their form
- **Chromatic Distortion**: Display unnatural color patterns that strain the observer's vision
- **Spatial Warping**: Create minor distortions in space around their immediate vicinity

## Magical Affinity

**Mana Blights** represent a dangerous perversion of normal magical energy:

| Aspect | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Mana Storage** | Abnormal (capable of containing high concentrations of Wild Mana) |
| **Purification** | Inverse (actively corrupt Base Mana into Wild Mana) |
| **Specialization Pattern** | Chaotic (unpredictable, uncontrolled elemental manifestations) |
| **Natural Affinity** | Wild Mana primarily; often demonstrate erratic elemental discharges |

### Magical Disruptions

Mana Blights create several magical anomalies in their vicinity:

- **Phase 1 Interference**: Disrupt the Wild Mana to Base Mana conversion process in living beings
- **Pattern Dissolution**: Erode established magical patterns like wards, enchantments, and ongoing spells
- **Resonance Contamination**: Corrupt the harmonic frequencies used in specialization
- **Energy Absorption**: Drain ambient magical energy to fuel their own unstable existence

### Dangerous Magical Traits

- **Wild Surge Generation**: Produce unpredictable bursts of untamed magical energy
- **Base Mana Corruption**: Convert stable Base Mana into chaotic Wild Mana on contact
- **Resonance Disruption**: Interfere with spellcasting within their proximity (10-100 foot radius)
- **Pattern Interference**: Cause established magical patterns to degrade or fail

## Habitat and Formation

**Mana Blights** form in areas where magical energy has been corrupted or disrupted:

| Formation Site | Blight Type | Formation Trigger |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Failed Ritual Sites** | Complex Blights | Catastrophic spell failure |
| **Magical Waste Areas** | Toxic Blights | Accumulation of magical byproducts |
| **Planar Breach Points** | Void Blights | Improper interdimensional contact |
| **Ley Line Ruptures** | Elemental Blights | Natural magical upheaval |

### Formation Process

1. **Magical Disruption**: Initial event creates unstable Wild Mana concentration
2. **Energy Accumulation**: Wild Mana begins to coalesce and attract more energy
3. **Pattern Corruption**: Emergence of anti-harmonious resonance patterns
4. **Matter Incorporation**: Absorption of physical material to create quasi-stable form
5. **Consciousness Development**: In rare cases, emergence of primitive awareness

## Behavioral Patterns

Despite generally lacking true consciousness, Mana Blights display consistent behavioral tendencies:

### Instinctive Behaviors

- **Energy Hunger**: Constant drive to absorb additional magical energy
- **Territorial Expansion**: Gradual spreading from point of origin
- **Pattern Erasure**: Seem to specifically target and degrade organized magical structures
- **Environmental Corruption**: Convert surrounding area to match their chaotic resonance

### Environmental Impact

Mana Blights create progressively worsening magical contamination zones:

| Zone Range | Effects | Duration After Removal |
|------------|---------|------------------------|
| Inner Zone (0-30ft) | Complete magical disruption, physical corruption | 1-5 years |
| Middle Zone (30-100ft) | Spell failure, resonance distortion, Wild Mana saturation | 3-12 months |
| Outer Zone (100-300ft) | Reduced spell effectiveness, increased Wild Mana content | 1-4 weeks |
| Fringe Zone (300-1000ft) | Subtle magical interference, enhanced Wild Mana presence | 1-7 days |

### Growth and Expansion

Without containment, Blights follow a predictable growth pattern:

1. **Nascent Stage**: Small, relatively stable, limited radius of effect
2. **Feeding Stage**: Rapid energy absorption, increasing size and instability
3. **Expansion Stage**: Territory growth, development of stronger disruption fields
4. **Critical Mass**: Eventually reaching unstable size leading to catastrophic discharge or collapse

## Containment and Countermeasures

Magical authorities have developed specific protocols for dealing with Mana Blights:

### Detection Methods

- **Specialized Divination**: Modified detection spells that identify resonance distortions
- **Elemental Reactions**: Certain purified elemental substances react visibly to Blight presence
- **Familiar Response**: Trained magical familiars can sense Blights at great distances
- **Symptom Recognition**: Environmental changes and spell behavior anomalies

### Containment Techniques

| Method | Effectiveness | Limitations |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Harmonic Barrier** | High for small/medium Blights | Requires constant maintenance |
| **Purification Circle** | Moderate | Works only on newer formations |
| **Mana Siphoning** | Variable | Dangerous to practitioners |
| **Resonance Inversion** | Very High | Requires master-level skill |

### Neutralization Procedures

The most effective approaches to eliminating Mana Blights include:

1. **Containment**: Establishing barriers to prevent expansion
2. **Isolation**: Separating the Blight from external energy sources
3. **Purification**: Controlled conversion of Wild Mana to Base Mana
4. **Dissipation**: Careful dispersion of the energy concentration
5. **Transmutation**: In extreme cases, converting the entire energy mass into another form

## Classification System

The Arcane Containment Authority classifies Mana Blights by threat level:

| Class | Characteristics | Containment Protocol | Response Team |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Alpha** | Nascent, under 2ft diameter | Standard containment | Local mages |
| **Beta** | Established, 2-5ft diameter | Active purification | Regional specialists |
| **Gamma** | Mature, 5-10ft diameter | Full containment team | Authority response unit |
| **Delta** | Critical, 10ft+ diameter | Emergency protocol | Master mage intervention |
| **Omega** | Catastrophic, regional threat | Evacuation and isolation | Multiple master mages |

## Magical Mechanics Analysis

Mana Blights provide key insights into magical theory through their abnormal properties:

### Mana Purification Inversion

While normal magical beings convert Wild Mana into stable Base Mana, Blights demonstrate the reverse process:

- **Purity Degradation**: Convert purified mana back to chaotic Wild Mana state
- **Harmonic Disruption**: Create dissonant frequencies that interfere with stable resonance
- **Pattern Corruption**: Introduce errors and instability into organized magical structures

### Phase Transition Impact

Blights disrupt both phases of the standard mana conversion process:

- **Phase 1 Interference**: Prevent efficient absorption and conversion of Wild Mana
- **Phase 2 Corruption**: Destabilize Base Mana undergoing elemental specialization

### Resonance Manifestations

The chaotic resonance patterns of Blights manifest in observable phenomena:

- **Visual Distortions**: Light bends unpredictably near Blight boundaries
- **Auditory Anomalies**: Witnesses report discordant sounds at the edge of hearing
- **Thermal Fluctuations**: Erratic temperature changes in the vicinity
- **Temporal Inconsistencies**: Minor time flow variations within the contamination zone

## Historical Incidents

Several notable Mana Blight incidents have been documented:

- **The Azurefall Catastrophe**: Formation of a Delta-class Blight following an experimental teleportation ritual failure
- **Westmarch Academy Incident**: Beta-class Blight containment breach resulting in the loss of an entire research wing
- **Silverlake Anomaly**: Naturally occurring Gamma-class Blight from a ley line rupture, now a permanent research site
- **Thornwood Corruption**: Ongoing Omega-class Blight that has transformed an entire forest into a magical dead zone
