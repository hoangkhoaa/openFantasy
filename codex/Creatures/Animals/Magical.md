# OpenFantasy Dungeons

Welcome to the world of OpenFantasy Dungeons! This document will guide you through the basics of creating and exploring dungeons within the OpenFantasy system.

## What is a Dungeon?

A dungeon is a procedurally generated environment filled with challenges, monsters, and treasures. In OpenFantasy, dungeons are designed to be modular and customizable, allowing Game Masters (Directores de Juego) to create unique and engaging experiences for their players.

## Key Components

*   **Rooms:** The fundamental building blocks of a dungeon. Each room can contain various elements, such as monsters, traps, and treasure.
*   **Corridors:** Connect rooms together, providing pathways for players to navigate the dungeon.
*   **Monsters:** Creatures that inhabit the dungeon and pose a threat to players.
*   **Traps:** Hidden hazards that can damage or hinder players.
*   **Treasure:** Valuable items and resources that players can discover and collect.

## Creating a Dungeon

To create a dungeon in OpenFantasy, you will need to define the following parameters:

*   **Size:** The overall size of the dungeon, typically measured in number of rooms.
*   **Complexity:** The level of interconnectedness between rooms. A more complex dungeon will have more corridors and branching paths.
*   **Theme:** The overall aesthetic and atmosphere of the dungeon. Examples include:
    *   Ancient Ruins (Ruinas Antiguas)
    *   Forgotten Temple (Templo Olvidado)
    *   Goblin Stronghold (Fortaleza Goblin)
*   **Monster Types:** The types of monsters that will inhabit the dungeon.
*   **Treasure Types:** The types of treasure that can be found in the dungeon.

## Example Dungeon Configuration

Here's an example of a dungeon configuration in JSON format:

```json
{
  "size": 20,
  "complexity": "medium",
  "theme": "Ancient Ruins",
  "monster_types": ["skeleton", "zombie", "ghost"],
  "treasure_types": ["gold", "scroll", "potion"]
}
```

## Exploring a Dungeon

Once a dungeon has been created, players can explore it using their characters. The Game Master (Director de Juego) will describe the environment and present challenges for the players to overcome. Players can use their skills and abilities to navigate the dungeon, fight monsters, disarm traps, and collect treasure.

## Example Room Description

"You enter a large, crumbling chamber. The walls are covered in ancient carvings, and a faint light filters in from a hole in the ceiling. In the center of the room, you see a skeleton guarding a treasure chest."

## Dungeon Generation Algorithm

OpenFantasy uses a custom dungeon generation algorithm to create unique and varied dungeons. The algorithm takes into account the parameters defined by the Game Master (Director de Juego) and generates a dungeon map consisting of rooms and corridors. The algorithm also populates the dungeon with monsters, traps, and treasure based on the specified types.
