## Core Concepts

### World (Monde)

The World (Monde) represents the game environment. It consists of locations, regions, and the overall lore of the game.

### Character (Personnage)

A Character (Personnage) is an entity within the game world that can interact with the environment and other characters.

### Story (Histoire)

The Story (Histoire) is the sequence of events that unfold within the game. It is driven by player choices, character interactions, and the game's rule system.
