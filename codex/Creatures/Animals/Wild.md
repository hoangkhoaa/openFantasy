# Welcome to the OpenFantasy RPG System!

This document outlines the core mechanics of the OpenFantasy role-playing game system. OpenFantasy is designed to be modular and adaptable, allowing Game Masters (Directores de Juego) to customize the rules to fit their specific setting and preferences.

## Core Concepts

*   **Attributes:** Characters possess six core Attributes (Atributos): Strength (Fuerza), Dexterity (Destreza), Constitution (Constitución), Intelligence (Inteligencia), Wisdom (Sabiduría), and Charisma (Carisma). These represent a character's inherent capabilities.

*   **Skills:** Skills (Habilidades) represent learned abilities and proficiencies. Skills are tied to specific Attributes (Atributos) and are used to resolve actions.

*   **Dice Rolls:** The primary mechanic for resolving actions involves rolling a 20-sided die (d20) (d20) and adding relevant modifiers.

*   **Difficulty Class (DC):** The Difficulty Class (DC) (Clase de Dificultad (CD)) represents the target number that must be met or exceeded on a dice roll to succeed at an action.

## Character Creation

1.  **Determine Attributes (Atributos):** Generate Attribute (Atributo) scores using one of the following methods:
    *   Standard Array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
    *   Point Buy: Allocate a set number of points to increase Attribute (Atributo) scores.
    *   Dice Rolling: Roll 4d6, drop the lowest die, and sum the remaining three dice for each Attribute (Atributo).

2.  **Choose a Race (Raza):** Select a Race (Raza) for your character. Each Race (Raza) provides unique benefits and traits. Example:

    | Race (Raza)     | Attribute Bonus (Bonificación de Atributo) | Special Traits (Rasgos Especiales)                                   |
    | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Humans (Humanos)  | \+1 to all Attributes (Atributos)          | Versatile: Gain one additional Skill Proficiency (Competencia de Habilidad). |
    | Elves (Elfos)   | \+2 Dexterity (Destreza)                  | Darkvision (Visión en la Oscuridad): See in dim light within 60 feet. |
    | Dwarves (Enanos) | \+2 Constitution (Constitución)            | Stonecunning (Conocimiento de la Piedra): Advantage on History checks related to stonework. |

3.  **Choose a Class (Clase):** Select a Class (Clase) for your character. Each Class (Clase) provides unique abilities, proficiencies, and playstyles. Example:

    | Class (Clase)    | Primary Attribute (Atributo Principal) | Proficiencies (Competencias)                                       |
    | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Fighter (Guerrero) | Strength (Fuerza) or Dexterity (Destreza) | Armor (Armadura), Weapons (Armas), Simple Weapons (Armas Simples) |
    | Rogue (Pícaro)    | Dexterity (Destreza)                     | Simple Weapons (Armas Simples), Hand Crossbows (Ballestas de Mano)|
    | Wizard (Mago)    | Intelligence (Inteligencia)              | Daggers (Dagas), Darts (Dardos), Slings (Hondas), Quarterstaffs (Bastones) |

4.  **Determine Skills (Habilidades):** Choose a number of Skill Proficiencies (Competencias de Habilidad) based on your Class (Clase) and Race (Raza).

## Gameplay

*   **Actions:** During their turn in combat, a character can take one Action (Acción), one Bonus Action (Acción Adicional), and has a Movement (Movimiento) allowance.

*   **Checks:** To perform an action with a chance of failure, a character makes a Check (Prueba). This usually involves rolling a d20, adding the relevant Attribute (Atributo) modifier and Skill (Habilidad) modifier (if proficient), and comparing the total to the Difficulty Class (DC) (Clase de Dificultad (CD)).

    *   Example: To climb a wall (parede), a character might make a Strength (Fuerza) (Athletics) Check (Prueba) against a DC (CD) determined by the wall's difficulty.

*   **Combat:** Combat is turn-based. Characters act in initiative order. Possible actions include attacking, casting spells, moving, and using items.

## Example Scenario

The party enters a dark forest (bosque oscuro) and encounters a Goblin (Duende) ambush!

1.  The Game Master (Director de Juego) determines the Goblin's (Duende) stats and sets the scene.
2.  Each player rolls initiative (iniciativa) (Dexterity (Destreza) check).
3.  Characters and Goblins (Duendes) act in initiative order, taking actions such as attacking with weapons, casting spells, or using skills.
4.  Dice rolls determine the success or failure of actions.
5.  The battle continues until one side is defeated or retreats.

This is a basic overview of the OpenFantasy RPG System. Further details on specific rules and mechanics will be provided in subsequent documents. Have fun exploring the world of OpenFantasy!
