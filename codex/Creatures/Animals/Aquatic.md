# Welcome to OpenFantasy!

This is the documentation for the OpenFantasy project. OpenFantasy is a free and open-source framework for creating tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). It provides a flexible and extensible system for defining game rules, creating characters, and running game sessions.

## Core Concepts

*   **Game System (Spielsystem)**: The overall rules and mechanics of the game. OpenFantasy provides a base game system that can be customized and extended.
*   **Character (Charakter)**: A player-controlled entity in the game. Characters have attributes, skills, and other properties that define their abilities.
*   **Session (Sitzung)**: A single instance of playing the game. Sessions involve a Game Master (GM) and one or more players.
*   **Game Master (GM) (Spielleiter (SL))**: The person who facilitates the game session and controls the non-player characters (NPCs).
*   **Non-Player Character (NPC) (Nicht-Spieler-Charakter (NSC))**: Characters in the game world that are controlled by the Game Master (GM).

## Key Features

*   **Modularity**: OpenFantasy is designed to be modular, allowing you to easily add or remove features.
*   **Extensibility**: You can extend OpenFantasy with custom code to add new rules, character types, and game mechanics.
*   **Data-Driven**: OpenFantasy uses data files to define game content, making it easy to create and modify game settings.
*   **Open Source**: OpenFantasy is licensed under the MIT License, so you can use it for free in your own projects.
