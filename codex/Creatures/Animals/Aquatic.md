Here's a simplified example of how character creation might work in OpenFantasy:

```python
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, race, class):
        self.name = name
        self.race = race
        self.class = class

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Race: {self.race}, Class: {self.class}"

# Example usage
my_character = Character("Alice", "Elf", "Wizard")
print(my_character)
```
