# Welcome to OpenFantasy!

OpenFantasy is a new open-source project to create a collaborative fantasy world-building platform. Think of it as a wiki combined with a world-building tool, all powered by AI.

## Key Features

*   **Collaborative Worldbuilding:** Build a world together with friends or strangers.
*   **AI-Powered Assistance:** Use AI to help you generate ideas, flesh out details, and write stories.
*   **Open Source:** The entire project is open source, so you can contribute to the development or host your own instance.
*   **Modular Design:** The platform is designed to be modular, so you can easily add new features or customize the existing ones.

## Core Components

*   **World Editor:** A visual editor for creating and editing maps, locations, and other world elements.
*   **Knowledge Base:** A structured database for storing information about the world, such as characters, items, and events.
*   **Story Generator:** An AI-powered tool for generating stories based on the world's information.
*   **API:** A REST API for accessing and manipulating the world's data.
