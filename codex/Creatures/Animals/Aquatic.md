# OpenFantasy Dungeons

Welcome to the depths of *OpenFantasy Dungeons*! This module provides the tools and systems to create and manage dungeons within the OpenFantasy framework.

## Core Concepts

*   **Dungeon Master (ダンジョンマスター)**: The architect and narrator of the dungeon experience. They control the environment, the monsters, and the overall story.
*   **Player Character (プレイヤーキャラクター)**: The adventurers who brave the dungeon's dangers.
*   **Rooms (部屋)**: The discrete locations within the dungeon.
*   **Monsters (モンスター)**: The creatures that inhabit the dungeon and challenge the players.
*   **Traps (罠)**: Hidden dangers that can harm unsuspecting adventurers.
*   **Treasure (宝物)**: Rewards for overcoming challenges and exploring the dungeon.

## Creating a Dungeon

To create a dungeon, you will need to define the following:

1.  **Dungeon Layout (ダンジョンレイアウト)**: The arrangement of rooms and corridors within the dungeon. This can be a simple map or a complex network of interconnected areas.
2.  **Room Descriptions (部屋の説明)**: Detailed descriptions of each room, including its size, contents, and any notable features.
3.  **Monster Encounters (モンスターとの遭遇)**: The creatures that inhabit each room and their behavior.
4.  **Trap Placement (罠の配置)**: The location and type of traps within the dungeon.
5.  **Treasure Placement (宝物の配置)**: The location and type of treasure within the dungeon.

## Example Dungeon: The Goblin Caves

Here's a simple example of a dungeon:

### Dungeon Layout (ダンジョンレイアウト)

The Goblin Caves (ゴブリンの洞窟) consist of three rooms connected by a narrow corridor.

*   **Entrance (入口)**: A small cave opening leading into the corridor.
