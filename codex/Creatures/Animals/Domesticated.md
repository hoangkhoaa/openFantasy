## Example: Character Creation

Here's a simplified example of how you might create a character in OpenFantasy:

| Feature (특징)    | Description (설명)                                              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Race (종족)      | Humans (인간), Elves (엘프), Dwarves (드워프), Orcs (오크)          |
| Class (직업)     | Warrior (전사), Mage (마법사), Thief (도둑), Cleric (성직자)          |
| Attributes (속성) | Strength (힘), Dexterity (민첩성), Intelligence (지능), Wisdom (지혜) |
| Skills (기술)    | Athletics (운동), Stealth (잠행), Arcana (비전), Persuasion (설득)    |

Let's create a Human (인간) Warrior (전사) with the following attributes:

*   Strength (힘): 16
*   Dexterity (민첩성): 14
*   Intelligence (지능): 10
*   Wisdom (지혜): 8

This character would also have skills based on their race (종족) and class (직업).
