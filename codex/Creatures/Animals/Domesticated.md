# Welcome to OpenFantasy!

OpenFantasy is a framework for creating and playing text-based fantasy games. It is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to create your own unique worlds, characters, and stories.

## Core Concepts

*   **World (世界)**: The game environment, including locations, items, and characters.
*   **Character (キャラクター)**: A player or non-player character (NPC) in the game.
*   **Item (アイテム)**: An object that can be used by a character.
*   **Story (物語)**: The narrative of the game.
*   **Rule (ルール)**: A mechanic governing the game's behavior.

## Example Game: The Goblin Caves

Let's create a simple game where a player explores a cave filled with goblins.

### Defining the World (世界の定義)

We'll start by defining a simple world with a single location:

```python
from OpenFantasy import World, Location

world = World("Goblin Caves (ゴブリンの洞窟)")
cave = Location("Cave Entrance (洞窟の入り口)", "A dark and damp cave entrance.")
world.add_location(cave)
```

### Creating a Character (キャラクターの作成)

Now let's create a player character:

```python
from OpenFantasy import Character

player = Character("Hero (主人公)", "A brave adventurer.")
player.location = cave
```

### Adding Items (アイテムの追加)

Let's add a sword and a potion to the game:

```python
from OpenFantasy import Item

sword = Item("Sword (剣)", "A sharp, steel sword.")
potion = Item("Potion (ポーション)", "A healing potion.")
player.add_item(sword)
player.add_item(potion)
```

### Defining Rules (ルールの定義)

Let's create a simple rule for fighting goblins:

```python
from OpenFantasy import Rule

def fight_goblin(player, goblin):
  # Simplified combat logic
  if "Sword (剣)" in [item.name for item in player.items]:
    print("You slay the goblin with your sword! (剣でゴブリンを倒した！)")
  else:
    print("The goblin overpowers you! (ゴブリンに圧倒された！)")

goblin_rule = Rule("Fight Goblin (ゴブリンとの戦闘)", fight_goblin)
```

### Adding a Goblin (ゴブリンの追加)

```python
from OpenFantasy import Character

goblin = Character("Goblin (ゴブリン)", "A small, green creature.")
goblin.location = cave
goblin.rules.append(goblin_rule) # Add the fight rule to the goblin
```

### Running the Game (ゲームの実行)

This is a basic example.  A full game would involve more complex logic, user input, and a more detailed story.

## Extending OpenFantasy

OpenFantasy is designed to be extensible. You can create your own:

*   Locations
*   Characters
*   Items
*   Rules
*   Worlds
*   Stories
