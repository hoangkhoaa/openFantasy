# Welcome to the OpenFantasy System Reference Document

This document describes the game mechanics of the OpenFantasy system. It is designed to be a comprehensive reference for both players and game masters (GMs).

## Core Concepts

The OpenFantasy system revolves around a few core concepts:

*   **Attributes (属性)**: These define a character's inherent capabilities.
*   **Skills (技能)**: These represent a character's learned abilities.
*   **Challenges (挑战)**: The system uses dice rolls to resolve challenges.
*   **Narrative (叙述)**: The GM guides the narrative and adjudicates the rules.

## Attributes

Attributes (属性) define a character's inherent capabilities. There are six core attributes in OpenFantasy:

*   **Strength (力量)**: Measures physical power.
*   **Dexterity (敏捷)**: Measures agility and reflexes.
*   **Constitution (体质)**: Measures health and endurance.
*   **Intelligence (智力)**: Measures reasoning and knowledge.
*   **Wisdom (智慧)**: Measures perception and intuition.
*   **Charisma (魅力)**: Measures force of personality.

## Skills

Skills (技能) represent a character's learned abilities. Each skill is associated with an attribute. When attempting a task, a character rolls a die and adds their skill bonus and attribute modifier.

Example Skills:

*   Athletics (运动): Associated with Strength (力量)
*   Acrobatics (杂技): Associated with Dexterity (敏捷)
*   Survival (生存): Associated with Wisdom (智慧)
*   Persuasion (说服): Associated with Charisma (魅力)

## Challenges

The OpenFantasy system uses a d20 (20面骰子) system for resolving challenges (挑战).

1.  The GM determines the Difficulty Class (DC) (难度等级) of the challenge.
2.  The player rolls a d20 (20面骰子), adds relevant attribute modifiers and skill bonuses.
3.  If the total is equal to or greater than the DC (难度等级), the challenge is successful.
