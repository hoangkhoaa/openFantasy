# Animals of OpenFantasy

> *"From the smallest songbird to the mightiest leviathan, the animal kingdom provides the vibrant backdrop against which all stories unfold."*

## Overview

Animals in OpenFantasy represent the diverse non-sentient fauna that inhabit the world's ecosystems. While they lack the advanced reasoning and civilization-building capabilities of sentient species, animals possess varying degrees of intelligence, instinct, and in some cases, innate magical properties.

Unlike the purely magical beings or constructed creatures, animals evolved naturally within the world's ecosystems, though some have been influenced by magical environments or selective breeding by sentient species.

## Elemental Composition

Animals typically have a higher proportion of Exanthis (physical form) compared to Soul and Mana Capacity, with some notable exceptions:

| Animal Category | Typical Elemental Ratio | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Common Mundane | E: 75-90%, S: 8-20%, M: 2-5% | Most standard wildlife |
| Companion Animals | E: 65-85%, S: 12-25%, M: 3-10% | Domesticated species with higher intelligence |
| Apex Predators | E: 70-85%, S: 10-20%, M: 5-15% | Evolved for hunting efficiency |
| Magical Animals | E: 50-75%, S: 5-15%, M: 15-45% | Species with innate magical properties |

## Animal Classifications

### Domesticated Animals

Species that have been selectively bred by sentient races for specific purposes:

| Category | Examples | Primary Uses |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Working Animals** | Horses, oxen, pack mules | Transportation, agriculture, labor |
| **Companion Animals** | Dogs, cats, small birds | Emotional bonding, protection, pest control |
| **Livestock** | Cattle, sheep, poultry | Food production, materials (wool, leather) |
| **Guardian Beasts** | Wardogs, sentinel falcons | Security, perimeter control |

→ See [Domesticated Animals](Domesticated.md) for detailed information.

### Wild Animals

Creatures that exist independently in natural ecosystems:

| Category | Examples | Ecological Role |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Herbivores** | Deer, rabbits, grazing beasts | Primary consumers, seed dispersal |
| **Predators** | Wolves, large cats, birds of prey | Population control, ecosystem balance |
| **Scavengers** | Vultures, carrion beetles | Decomposition, disease prevention |
| **Pollinators** | Bees, butterflies, hummingbirds | Plant reproduction, ecosystem sustainability |

→ See [Wild Animals](Wild.md) for detailed information.

### Aquatic Creatures

Beings adapted to life in water environments:

| Category | Examples | Habitat |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Marine Mammals** | Whales, dolphins, seals | Oceans, coastal waters |
| **Fish Species** | Trout, sharks, deep-sea species | Rivers, lakes, oceans |
| **Crustaceans & Mollusks** | Crabs, octopi, giant squid | Ocean floors, tidal zones |
| **Amphibious** | Frogs, newts, transitional species | Wetlands, shorelines |

→ See [Aquatic Animals](Aquatic.md) for detailed information.

### Magical Animals

Creatures with innate magical properties, evolved in areas with high mana concentration:

| Category | Examples | Magical Properties |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Elemental Aligned** | Phoenixes, frost wolves | Manifestation of elemental energies |
| **Mythical Beasts** | Griffins, unicorns, manticores | Complex magical anatomies |
| **Mana Sensitives** | Arcane ravens, spell hounds | Detection and interaction with magical energies |
| **Transmuted Species** | Crystal butterflies, glowfish | Permanently altered by magical environments |

→ See [Magical Animals](Magical.md) for detailed information.

## Ecological Significance

Animals play crucial roles in maintaining the ecological balance of OpenFantasy:

### Natural Cycles

- **Food Webs**: Complex interdependent relationships between species
- **Material Cycles**: Contribution to nutrient cycling through consumption and decomposition
- **Environmental Shaping**: Landscape modification through grazing, burrowing, and other behaviors
- **Magical Energy Distribution**: Some species serve as natural conduits or regulators of magical energy

### Interactions with Sentient Species

- **Resource Provision**: Food, materials, labor, and transportation
- **Companionship**: Emotional bonds between animals and sentient beings
- **Magical Assistance**: Familiars, magical detection, spell components
- **Cultural Significance**: Symbolism, spiritual importance, artistic inspiration

## Mana Interaction

While most animals cannot consciously manipulate mana as sentient species do, their relationship with magical energy takes various forms:

| Interaction Type | Manifestation | Examples |
|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Passive Absorption** | Accumulation of ambient magical energy | Animals in mana-rich environments gradually developing magical traits |
| **Instinctive Channeling** | Natural, non-conscious use of magical abilities | A phoenix's rebirth cycle, a unicorn's purification abilities |
| **Environmental Adaptation** | Physical changes in response to magical surroundings | Creatures in wild magic zones developing protective adaptations |
| **Familiar Bonds** | Enhanced magical capabilities through connection with mages | Wizard's familiar gaining intelligence and magical resistance |

## Ecological Zones and Endemic Species

OpenFantasy features diverse biomes, each with specialized animal adaptations:

| Biome | Notable Species | Special Adaptations |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Frostwilds** | Snow lions, glacier bears, frost eagles | Cold resistance, seasonal camouflage |
| **Verdant Plains** | Thunderhooves (bison), prairie wolves, hawk swarms | Herd behaviors, endurance migration |
| **Ancient Forests** | Shadowbears, treestriders, whispermoths | Magical camouflage, connection to forest spirits |
| **Desert Expanse** | Sand wyrms, heat scorpions, mirage gazelles | Water conservation, heat regulation |
| **Enchanted Marshes** | Glowtoads, spell leeches, mist cranes | Mana filtration, magical detoxification |
| **Crystal Mountains** | Stone eagles, echo goats, geomite swarms | Mineral metabolism, navigation in magnetic fields |
| **Abyssal Depths** | Pressure sharks, luminfin anglers, void eels | Extreme pressure adaptation, bioluminescence |
