# **Golems**: The Artificially Crafted Guardians

[**Golems**](/codex/Creatures/Golems.md) are the artificially crafted guardians, their bodies a constructed harmony of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a grand pipe organ, they resonate with the power of their creators, creating a unique melody of existence that bridges the artificial and natural realms.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **golems** forms a harmony that favors physical resilience:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 60-85% | The crystalline heart that grants exceptional durability and strength |
| **Soul** | 5-15% | The ethereal essence that shapes a focused but limited consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 10-30% | The bridge between worlds that enables limited magical potential |

This composition grants **golems** their characteristic resilience and strength but typically limits their adaptability compared to other species, like a massive instrument that can only play a limited range of notes.

### Individual Variations

While the model composition represents the typical golem, individual variations exist based on their creators' designs:

- **War Golems**: Military-grade constructs possess Exanthis levels as high as 90%, making them nearly indestructible, though with minimal consciousness (5% Soul) and magical ability (5% Mana Capacity).
- **Arcane Guardians**: Specialized variants designed for magical tasks have enhanced Mana Capacity approaching 40%, allowing them to interact with and guard against magical forces, often with reduced physical mass (50% Exanthis).
- **Sentient Constructs**: Rare golems created with higher Soul percentages (up to 25%) develop more complex consciousness and autonomy, often becoming leaders among golem societies.
- **Runic Vessels**: Specialized golems with composition of (60% Exanthis, 5% Soul, 35% Mana Capacity) serve as living magical batteries and conduits for powerful spells.
- **Shapeshifting Golems**: Advanced designs with a balanced composition (55% Exanthis, 15% Soul, 30% Mana Capacity) can reconfigure their physical forms for different tasks.

## Physical Characteristics

**Golems** are known for their diverse forms and constructed nature:
- Bodies crafted from various materials, from stone and metal to crystal and wood
- Size ranging from small servitors to massive guardians, depending on their purpose
- Eyes that glow with inner light, reflecting their connection to their creators
- Joints and mechanisms that allow for movement, though often limited in flexibility
- Runes and sigils etched into their bodies, containing the magic that animates them
- No need for food, sleep, or other biological functions, like instruments that play without rest

## Physical and Magical Affinity

**Golems** demonstrate exceptional proficiency in physical resilience and strength, like masterfully crafted instruments designed for a specific purpose. Their composition allows them to:
- Develop extraordinary durability and strength, like living fortresses
- Resist magical effects through their high **Exanthis** content, like a stone breaking the surface of a magical pond
- Perform repetitive tasks with perfect precision, like a well-tuned machine

This resilience makes **golems** capable of achieving feats of endurance that other species can only dream of, though they may struggle with tasks requiring adaptability or creativity, like an instrument that can only play the notes it was designed to play.

## Lifespan and Soul Decay

The **soul decay** timeline for **golems**, from creation to complete decay, is approximately 1000 years, like a slow-burning forge that illuminates the ages. This extended lifespan allows them to:
- Serve their creators and fulfill their designated purposes for centuries
- Develop deep connections to specific places and tasks
- Form stable societies with strong hierarchical structures

However, their minimal soul ratio also means they change and adapt very slowly, like a melody that remains constant through the ages.

## Habitat and Distribution

**Golems** primarily inhabit:
- Cities and fortresses, where they serve as guardians and laborers
- Magical workshops and laboratories, where they assist in magical research
- Ancient ruins and forgotten places, where they continue to fulfill their original purposes

These locations provide ideal environments for the golems to fulfill their designated purposes, like stages perfectly suited to their performance.
