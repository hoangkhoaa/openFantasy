## Overview

All creatures in OpenFantasy are composed of three elemental components in varying ratios: [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md) (physical form), [**Soul**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md) (consciousness and willpower), and **Mana Capacity** (ability to manipulate [**Mana**](/codex/Basic/Mana.md)). These ratios determine their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

Different categories of beings—from sentient species to plants, from animals to monsters—each exhibit distinctive elemental compositions that influence their place in the world's ecology and society.

## Elemental Components

Each living being's composition can be understood through the proportion of three fundamental components:

| Component | Description | Metaphor |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Exanthis (E)** | Physical foundation providing structure and form | The body of an instrument |
| **Soul (S)** | Spark of consciousness providing will and identity | The musician who plays the instrument |
| **Mana Capacity (M)** | Bridge between worlds determining magical ability | The harmonies that weave everything together |

### Component Effects

| Component | Advantages | Limitations |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Exanthis** | Greater physical strength, endurance, and durability | Reduced magical potential due to magnetic interference with Mana |
| **Soul** | Enhanced consciousness, willpower, and identity | Accelerated soul decay resulting in shorter lifespans |
| **Mana Capacity** | Higher purity and control of Mana | May result in physical frailty due to lower Exanthis |

## Composition-Based Classification

Creatures in OpenFantasy are classified by their elemental composition and magical nature, rather than traditional biological taxonomies:

| Category | Exanthis | Soul | Mana | Examples |
|----------|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Physical Dominant** | 50%+ | Varied | <25% | Dwarves, Giants, Most Animals |
| **Soul Dominant** | <40% | 40%+ | <40% | Some Humans, Sirens, Gnomes |
| **Mana Dominant** | <30% | <40% | 50%+ | Elves, Fae, Elementals |
| **Balanced** | 20-50% | 20-50% | 20-50% | Humans, Some Beastfolk, Hybrid Species |

## Individual Variations

Within each species, individuals exhibit unique variations in their elemental composition, resulting in diverse abilities, temperaments, and aptitudes. These variations are influenced by:

- **Heredity**: Traits passed down through ancestral lines
- **Environment**: Environmental conditions during formative years
- **Life Experiences**: Significant events that alter elemental balance
- **Personal Development**: Intentional cultivation of specific elements
