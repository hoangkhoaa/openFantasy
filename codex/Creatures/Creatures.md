# **Creatures**: The Living Symphony of Creation

All creatures in OpenFantasy are composed of three elemental components in varying ratios: [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md) (which determines physical form), [**Soul**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md) (which determines consciousness and willpower), and **Mana Capacity** (which determines ability to manipulate [**Mana**](/codex/Basic/Mana.md)). These ratios determine their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, like different instruments in an orchestra creating distinct melodies of existence.

## Elemental Components

Each living being's composition can be understood through their proportion of three fundamental components:

- **Exanthis (E)**: The physical foundation that provides structure and form, like the body of an instrument
- **Soul (S)**: The spark of consciousness that provides will and identity, like the musician who plays the instrument
- **Mana Capacity (M)**: The bridge between worlds that determines ability to store, purify, and manipulate **Mana**, like the harmonies that weave everything together

### Component Effects

| Component | Advantages | Limitations |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Exanthis** | Greater physical strength, endurance, and durability | Reduced magical potential due to magnetic interference with Mana, like a stone breaking the surface of a still pond |
| **Soul** | Enhanced consciousness, willpower, and identity | Accelerated soul decay resulting in shorter lifespans, like a candle burning too brightly |
| **Mana Capacity** | Higher purity and control of Mana, like an artist painting with light itself | May result in physical frailty due to lower Exanthis, like a flame that burns too bright |

## Species Distribution

Different species occupy unique positions on the elemental composition spectrum, giving rise to their distinctive characteristics:

| Species | Exanthis | Soul | Mana Capacity | Notable Traits |
|---------|----------|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Humans** | 20-55% | 15-45% | 15-60% | Adaptable and balanced, like versatile instruments |
| **Elves** | 5-25% | 5-15% | 50-80% | Magically attuned with extended lifespans, like ancient instruments of perfect craftsmanship |
| **Dwarves** | 50-70% | 20-35% | 5-25% | Physically resilient with strong cultural identity, like deep bass instruments |
| **Beastfolk** | 35-70% | 15-35% | 15-40% | Physically powerful with strong instincts, like primal drums |
| **Fae** | 2-10% | 15-35% | 50-80% | Almost pure magical beings, like ethereal wind instruments |
| **Dragonkin** | 55-75% | 5-15% | 20-35% | Ancient and powerful, like instruments that resonate with primordial forces |

## Individual Variations

Within each species, individuals exhibit unique variations in their elemental composition, resulting in diverse abilities, temperaments, and aptitudes. These variations are influenced by:

- **Heredity**: Traits passed down through ancestral lines, like musical traditions
- **Environment**: Environmental conditions during formative years, like an instrument shaped by its climate
- **Life Experiences**: Significant events that alter elemental balance, like an instrument acquiring character through use
- **Personal Development**: Intentional cultivation of specific elements, like a musician honing their craft

### Common Enhancement Methods

Various methods exist for beings to enhance specific aspects of their elemental composition:

- **Physical Training**: Increases effective Exanthis utilization through disciplined exercise
- **Meditation and Will Work**: Strengthens Soul connection through focused introspection
- **Mana Reservoir Expansion**: Enhances ability to store and purify Mana through concentrated magical exposure, like a well being deepened to hold more water
