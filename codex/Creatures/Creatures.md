## Overview

All creatures in OpenFantasy are composed of three elemental components in varying ratios: [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md) (physical form), [**Soul**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md) (consciousness and willpower), and **Mana Capacity** (ability to manipulate [**Mana**](/codex/Basic/Mana.md)). These ratios determine their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

## Elemental Components

Each living being's composition can be understood through the proportion of three fundamental components:

| Component | Description | Metaphor |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Exanthis (E)** | Physical foundation providing structure and form | The body of an instrument |
| **Soul (S)** | Spark of consciousness providing will and identity | The musician who plays the instrument |
| **Mana Capacity (M)** | Bridge between worlds determining magical ability | The harmonies that weave everything together |

### Component Effects

| Component | Advantages | Limitations |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Exanthis** | Greater physical strength, endurance, and durability | Reduced magical potential due to magnetic interference with Mana |
| **Soul** | Enhanced consciousness, willpower, and identity | Accelerated soul decay resulting in shorter lifespans |
| **Mana Capacity** | Higher purity and control of Mana | May result in physical frailty due to lower Exanthis |

## Species Distribution

Different species occupy unique positions on the elemental composition spectrum:

| Species | Exanthis | Soul | Mana Capacity | Notable Traits |
|---------|----------|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Humans** | 20-55% | 15-45% | 15-60% | Adaptable and balanced |
| **Elves** | 5-25% | 5-15% | 50-80% | Magically attuned with extended lifespans |
| **Dwarves** | 50-70% | 20-35% | 5-25% | Physically resilient with strong cultural identity |
| **Beastfolk** | 35-70% | 15-35% | 15-40% | Physically powerful with strong instincts |
| **Fae** | 2-10% | 15-35% | 50-80% | Almost pure magical beings |
| **Dragonkin** | 55-75% | 5-15% | 20-35% | Ancient and powerful |

## Individual Variations

Within each species, individuals exhibit unique variations in their elemental composition, resulting in diverse abilities, temperaments, and aptitudes. These variations are influenced by:

- **Heredity**: Traits passed down through ancestral lines
- **Environment**: Environmental conditions during formative years
- **Life Experiences**: Significant events that alter elemental balance
- **Personal Development**: Intentional cultivation of specific elements

### Common Enhancement Methods

Various methods exist for beings to enhance specific aspects of their elemental composition:

| Method | Enhances | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Physical Training** | Exanthis | Increases effective Exanthis utilization through disciplined exercise |
| **Meditation and Will Work** | Soul | Strengthens Soul connection through focused introspection |
| **Mana Reservoir Expansion** | Mana Capacity | Enhances ability to store and purify Mana through magical exposure |
