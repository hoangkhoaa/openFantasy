# **Dragonkin**: The Ancient Children of Power

[**Dragonkin**](/codex/Creatures/Dragonkin.md) are the ancient children of power, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a timpani that commands attention with its powerful presence, they embody strength and elemental might, creating a unique melody of existence that emphasizes power, pride, and connection to the elements.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **dragonkin** forms a harmony that favors physical might:

| **Soul** | 5-15% | The ethereal essence that shapes a proud and territorial consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 20-35% | The bridge between worlds that enables elemental magical potential |

This composition grants **dragonkin** their characteristic physical might but limits their adaptability compared to other species, like a powerful instrument that produces commanding sounds but cannot play subtle melodies.

### Individual Variations

- **Soul Dragons**: Those with higher Soul percentages (up to 20%) develop exceptional wisdom and leadership abilities, often becoming powerful clan leaders or spiritual guides to their kind.
- **Elemental Incarnates**: Specialized dragonkin with composition of (60% Exanthis, 5% Soul, 35% Mana Capacity) can completely embody a specific elemental force, becoming living manifestations of fire, lightning, frost, or other elements.
