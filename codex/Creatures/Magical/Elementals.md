# Welcome to the OpenFantasy RPG system!

This document describes the core rules of the OpenFantasy role playing game system.

## Core Concepts

OpenFantasy is designed to be a simple, fast, and versatile system for running role playing games in any setting. The core concepts are:

*   **Attributes (Attributs)**: Characters have six attributes: Strength (Force), Dexterity (Dextérité), Constitution (Constitution), Intelligence (Intelligence), Wisdom (Sagesse), and Charisma (Charisme).
*   **Skills (Compétences)**: Characters have skills that they can use to perform actions. Skills are based on attributes.
*   **Dice (Dés)**: The system uses a d20 (dé à 20 faces) for most rolls, with modifiers added to the roll.
*   **Difficulty Class (Niveau de Difficulté)**: Every action has a Difficulty Class (ND) that the player must meet or exceed to succeed.

## Character Creation

Character creation is a simple process:

1.  **Choose a Race (Choisir une Race)**: Choose a race for your character.
2.  **Determine Attributes (Déterminer les Attributs)**: Roll or choose your character's attributes.
3.  **Choose Skills (Choisir des Compétences)**: Choose your character's skills.
4.  **Choose Equipment (Choisir l'Équipement)**: Choose your character's starting equipment.

### Races

| Race (Race) | Description (Description) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Humans (Humains) | Humans (Humains) are the most common race. |
| Elves (Elfes) | Elves (Elfes) are a graceful and intelligent race. |
| Dwarves (Nains) | Dwarves (Nains) are a hardy and strong race. |

### Attributes

Attributes are determined by rolling 4d6 (4d6) and dropping the lowest die. The attributes are:

*   Strength (Force): Measures physical power.
*   Dexterity (Dextérité): Measures agility and reflexes.
*   Constitution (Constitution): Measures health and stamina.
*   Intelligence (Intelligence): Measures reasoning and memory.
*   Wisdom (Sagesse): Measures perception and insight.
*   Charisma (Charisme): Measures force of personality.

### Skills

Skills are based on attributes. When a player attempts an action, they roll a d20 (dé à 20 faces), add their skill modifier, and compare the result to the Difficulty Class (Niveau de Difficulté).

## Combat

Combat is resolved using the same basic mechanics as other actions.

1.  **Initiative (Initiative)**: Roll initiative to determine the order of combat.
2.  **Actions (Actions)**: On your turn, you can take an action.
3.  **Attacks (Attaques)**: To attack, roll a d20 (dé à 20 faces), add your attack bonus, and compare the result to the target's Armor Class (Classe d'Armure).
4.  **Damage (Dégâts)**: If the attack hits, roll damage.

## Example

Here's a quick example of play:

*   The Game Master (Maître du Jeu) says, "You enter a dark forest (forêt sombre). You see a Goblin (Gobelin)!"
*   The player says, "I attack the Goblin (Gobelin) with my sword (épée)!"
*   The player rolls a d20 (dé à 20 faces), adds their attack bonus, and gets a 17 (17).
*   The Game Master (Maître du Jeu) says, "The Goblin's (Gobelin) Armor Class (Classe d'Armure) is 15 (15). You hit!"
*   The player rolls damage and deals 6 (6) damage.
*   The Game Master (Maître du Jeu) says, "The Goblin (Gobelin) falls to the ground, defeated (vaincu)!"
