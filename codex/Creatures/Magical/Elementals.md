# OpenFantasy Dungeons

Welcome to the OpenFantasy Dungeons! This document outlines the core mechanics and concepts for generating and exploring dungeons within the OpenFantasy framework.

## Dungeon Generation

The dungeon generation process relies on a combination of procedural generation techniques and pre-defined room templates.

### Core Components

*   **Rooms (部屋):** Individual spaces within the dungeon, connected by corridors.
*   **Corridors (通路):** Passages that connect rooms together.
*   **Connections (接続):** Points where rooms and corridors intersect.
*   **Themes (テーマ):** Overall style and atmosphere of the dungeon (e.g., "Ancient Ruins," "Goblin Caves").
*   **Difficulty (難易度):** Determines the challenge level of the dungeon, affecting monster types, trap frequency, and treasure quality.

### Generation Algorithm

1.  **Seed Generation (シード生成):** A random seed is used to initialize the dungeon generation process. This ensures that the same seed will always produce the same dungeon layout.
2.  **Room Placement (部屋の配置):** Rooms are placed within a grid or graph structure. The placement algorithm can vary, from simple random placement to more sophisticated techniques that consider room size and connectivity.
3.  **Corridor Carving (通路の作成):** Corridors are carved out to connect the placed rooms. Algorithms like random walks or maze generation can be used for this step.
4.  **Feature Decoration (特徴の装飾):** Features such as traps, treasure, and monsters are added to the rooms and corridors. The density and type of features are determined by the dungeon's difficulty and theme.
5.  **Theme Application (テーマの適用):** The visual and thematic elements of the dungeon are applied, such as textures, lighting, and sound effects.

## Dungeon Exploration

### Core Mechanics

*   **Movement (移動):** Players can move through the dungeon using a grid-based or free-form movement system.
*   **Combat (戦闘):** Players can engage in combat with monsters encountered within the dungeon.
*   **Traps (罠):** Players must avoid or disarm traps placed throughout the dungeon.
*   **Puzzles (パズル):** Players may encounter puzzles that must be solved to progress through the dungeon.
*   **Treasure (宝物):** Players can find treasure chests and other containers filled with valuable items.

### Example Dungeon Table

| Feature (特徴) | Description (説明)                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rooms (部屋)      | Vary in size and shape; may contain monsters, traps, puzzles, or treasure.            |
| Corridors (通路)  | Connect rooms together; may be narrow or wide, straight or winding.                 |
| Traps (罠)      | Can be triggered by player actions; may cause damage, status effects, or other penalties. |
| Treasure (宝物)   | Valuable items found within the dungeon; may include gold, weapons, armor, or artifacts. |
| Monsters (モンスター) | Creatures that inhabit the dungeon; may be hostile or neutral.                         |

### Room Types

*   **Entrance (入り口):** The starting point of the dungeon.
*   **Exit (出口):** The end point of the dungeon.
*   **Treasure Room (宝物部屋):** A room containing a large amount of treasure.
*   **Monster Lair (モンスターの巣):** A room inhabited by a powerful monster.
*   **Puzzle Room (パズル部屋):** A room containing a puzzle that must be solved.
*   **Empty Room (空の部屋):** A room containing nothing of interest.

## Customization

The OpenFantasy dungeon generation system is highly customizable. You can modify the generation algorithm, room templates, themes, and difficulty settings to create unique and challenging dungeons. This allows for endless possibilities and replayability within your OpenFantasy games.
