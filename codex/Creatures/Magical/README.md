# Magical Beings of OpenFantasy

> *"They are magic given form and purpose, the living embodiment of mystical forces that flow through our world."*

## Overview

Magical beings in OpenFantasy are creatures that are fundamentally composed of, created by, or infused with magical energy. Unlike sentient species that evolved naturally and merely use magic, magical beings have magic as an intrinsic part of their existence, often with their physical forms serving primarily as vessels for magical energies.

These beings are distinguished by their unusually high Mana Capacity, which typically exceeds that of natural creatures. Many originated during periods of intense magical activity or were created through deliberate magical processes, while others represent the physical manifestation of specific magical concepts or elements.

## Elemental Composition

Magical beings typically exhibit the following elemental composition ranges:

| Being Category | Exanthis | Soul | Mana Capacity | Notes |
|----------------|----------|------|---------------|-------|
| Fae | 2-10% | 15-35% | 50-80% | Almost pure magical entities |
| Elementals | 15-30% | 5-15% | 60-85% | Embodiments of elemental forces |
| Dragonkin | 55-75% | 5-15% | 20-35% | Ancient magical lineage |
| Constructs | 70-90% | 5-15% | 5-15% | Artificially created beings |
| Spiritfolk | 10-30% | 20-40% | 40-70% | Beings of manifested spiritual energy |
