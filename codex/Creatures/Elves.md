# **Elves**: The Eternal Seekers of Wisdom

[**Elves**](/codex/Creatures/Elves.md) are the eternal seekers of wisdom, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a flute that plays an endless melody, they embody grace and magical prowess, creating a unique harmony of existence that emphasizes longevity, knowledge, and magical mastery.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **elves** forms a harmony that favors magical prowess:

| **Mana Capacity** | 50-80% | The bridge between worlds that enables exceptional magical potential |

This composition grants **elves** their characteristic magical prowess and longevity but limits their physical strength compared to other species, like a delicate instrument that produces complex melodies but cannot match the power of a drum.
