# **Gnomes**: The Ingenious Crafters of Innovation

[**Gnomes**](/codex/Creatures/Gnomes.md) are the ingenious crafters of innovation, their bodies a delicate harmony of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a complex music box, they resonate with the precision of machinery, creating a unique melody of existence that bridges the magical and technological realms.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **gnomes** forms a harmony that favors adaptability:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 20-40% | The crystalline heart that provides minimal physical strength and durability |
| **Soul** | 30-50% | The ethereal essence that shapes a fluid and adaptable consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 25-40% | The bridge between worlds that enables moderate magical potential |

This composition grants **gnomes** their characteristic ingenuity and adaptability but typically limits their physical resilience compared to other species, like a delicate instrument that produces beautiful sounds but must be handled with care.

### Individual Variations

While the model composition represents the typical gnome, individual variations exist based on their guild affiliations:

- **Master Tinkerers**: Some gnomes from the Tinkerguild possess enhanced Soul percentages (up to 55%) that allow them extraordinary creativity and problem-solving abilities, often at the expense of physical strength (20% Exanthis).
- **Arcanists**: Specialized variants with higher Mana Capacity (up to 45%) excel at magical invention, creating devices that seamlessly blend technology and magic in ways other species find impossible.
- **Durability Engineers**: Rarer gnomes with enhanced Exanthis (up to 45%) focus on developing resilient technologies and often serve as field testers for dangerous inventions.
- **Alchemical Innovators**: A balanced variant (30% Exanthis, 40% Soul, 30% Mana Capacity) specializes in creating substances and potions that defy normal classification as either magical or technological.
- **Artifice Savants**: Some gnomes develop a unique composition (25% Exanthis, 35% Soul, 40% Mana Capacity) that allows them to intuitively understand magical artifacts and replicate their functions through technological means.

## Physical Characteristics

**Gnomes** are known for their small size and inventive nature:
- Height ranging from 3 to 4 feet, making them one of the smallest sentient species
- Proportionate build with delicate features, like finely crafted miniatures
- Eyes that sparkle with inner light, reflecting their connection to [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md)
- Hair that is often styled in elaborate designs, showcasing their creativity
- Hands with extra dexterity, allowing for precise manipulation of small objects
- Natural resistance to magical effects, like a well-insulated circuit

## Magical and Technological Affinity

**Gnomes** demonstrate exceptional proficiency in combining magic and technology, like virtuoso musicians who have mastered the art of harmony. Their composition allows them to:
- Create intricate magical devices that blend technology and enchantment, like composers who have perfected the art of the symphony
- Develop innovative solutions to complex problems, like artists who have mastered the art of improvisation
- Adapt quickly to new situations and technologies, like instruments that can play in any key

This specialization makes **gnomes** capable of achieving feats of ingenuity that few other species can match, though they may struggle with tasks requiring physical strength or resilience, like a delicate instrument that produces beautiful sounds but cannot withstand rough handling.

## Lifespan and Soul Decay
