| Component | Function | Influence |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Exanthis** | Physical foundation | Strength, endurance, durability |
| **Soul** | Consciousness and identity | Willpower, creativity, perception |
| **Mana Capacity** | Magical potential | Spell capability, magical resistance, mana purification |

For detailed information on these principles, see the [Creatures overview](Creatures.md).
