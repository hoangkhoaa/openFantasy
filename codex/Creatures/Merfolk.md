# **Merfolk**: The Guardians of the Deep

[**Merfolk**](/codex/Creatures/Merfolk.md) are the guardians of the deep, their bodies a fluid harmony of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a deep bassoon, they resonate with the currents of the ocean, creating a unique melody of existence that bridges the aquatic and terrestrial realms.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Creatures](/codex/Creatures/Creatures.md), the typical ratio for **merfolk** forms a harmony that favors physical grace:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 30-50% | The crystalline heart that provides moderate physical strength and grace |
| **Soul** | 25-40% | The ethereal essence that shapes a fluid and adaptable consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 20-40% | The bridge between worlds that enables moderate magical potential |

This composition grants **merfolk** their characteristic grace and adaptability but typically moderates their magical potential compared to other species, like a versatile instrument that can play many notes but lacks the power of a full orchestra.

### Individual Variations

While the model composition represents the typical merfolk, individual variations exist based on their tribal lineage:

- **Depth Divers**: Some merfolk, particularly from the Deepswimmer tribe, possess enhanced Exanthis levels (up to 55%) that allow them to withstand the crushing pressures of the deepest ocean trenches.
- **Tide Mages**: Specialized variants with higher Mana Capacity (up to 45%) excel at water magic, becoming powerful spellcasters who can control currents, weather, and even blood in living creatures.
- **Ocean Sages**: Those with higher Soul percentages (up to 45%) develop extraordinary empathy and wisdom, often becoming tribal leaders, healers, or diplomats who bridge the gap between merfolk and other species.
- **Reef Guardians**: A balanced variant (40% Exanthis, 30% Soul, 30% Mana Capacity) specializes in protecting coral reef ecosystems, developing unique magical abilities that nurture and restore damaged aquatic environments.
- **Storm Callers**: Some merfolk develop a unique composition (35% Exanthis, 25% Soul, 40% Mana Capacity) that allows them to sense and manipulate weather patterns above the ocean, creating or dispersing storms that might threaten their territories.

## Physical Characteristics

**Merfolk** are known for their aquatic adaptations and graceful nature:
- Humanoid upper bodies with fish-like lower bodies, allowing for efficient swimming
- Eyes that are adapted to see clearly in the depths, often with a slight luminescence
- Gills that allow them to breathe underwater, like delicate instruments attuned to the sea
- Scales that provide natural protection and beauty, ranging in color from iridescent blue to deep green
- Fins and webbed appendages that aid in swimming and balance
- Ability to change the color of their scales for camouflage or communication

## Physical and Magical Affinity

**Merfolk** demonstrate exceptional proficiency in swimming and aquatic combat, like virtuoso performers who have mastered their environment. Their composition allows them to:
- Move through water with extraordinary grace and speed, like dancers in a liquid ballet
- Channel water magic with moderate proficiency, like conductors of the ocean's symphony
- Adapt to various aquatic environments, from shallow reefs to the deepest trenches

This specialization makes **merfolk** capable of achieving feats of aquatic prowess that few other species can match, though they may struggle with tasks requiring complex magical abilities, like an instrument that can play many notes but lacks the complexity of a full orchestra.

## Lifespan and Soul Decay

The **soul decay** timeline for **merfolk**, from birth to complete decay, is approximately 300 years, like a steady flame that illuminates the depths. This moderate lifespan allows them to:
- Accumulate knowledge and wisdom over generations
- Develop deep connections to specific places and traditions
- Form stable societies with strong communal bonds

However, their moderate soul ratio also means they change and adapt at a moderate pace, like a melody that evolves with the tides.

## Habitat and Distribution

**Merfolk** primarily inhabit:
- Ocean depths and underwater cities, where they can be closest to the currents
- Coral reefs and kelp forests, where they can find shelter and resources
- Coastal regions and estuaries, where they can interact with terrestrial species
- Strategic locations that provide access to both aquatic and terrestrial resources

These locations provide ideal environments for the development of aquatic societies and the practice of water magic, like stages perfectly suited to their performance.

The connection to the ocean has shaped merfolk culture around respect for the sea, community, and tradition, creating a society where harmony with nature is highly valued.
