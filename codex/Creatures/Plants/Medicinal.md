Okay, here's the Markdown content translated to Chinese, preserving all formatting and original style:

```markdown
# Title in English - 中文标题

This is a paragraph with some **bold text** and some *italic text*. We also have a [link to Google](https://www.google.com).

## A Subheading in English - 中文小标题

Here's a list:

*   Item 1 - 项目1
*   Item 2 - 项目2
*   Item 3 - 项目3

Here's some code:

```python
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, World!")

hello_world()
```

And here's a table:

| Header 1 - 标题1 | Header 2 - 标题2 |
|---|---|
| Cell 1 - 单元格1 | Cell 2 - 单元格2 |
| Cell 3 - 单元格3 | Cell 4 - 单元格4 |

Another paragraph referencing `some_variable` and the `MyClass` class. We'll also mention the function `calculate_something()`. This is important for understanding the code in `my_module.py`.

Finally, let's add a blockquote:

> This is a quote from someone. - 这是来自某人的引言。
```
