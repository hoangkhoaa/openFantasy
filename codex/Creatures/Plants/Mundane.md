Welcome to the OpenFantasy role-playing game system! This is a flexible and open-source system designed for narrative-driven gameplay. This document outlines the core mechanics and rules.

*   **Skills:** Skills represent specific areas of expertise. Examples include: Athletics, Stealth, Arcana, and Persuasion.
*   **Checks:** To resolve uncertain outcomes, players make Checks by rolling a d20, adding relevant Attribute and Skill modifiers, and comparing the total to a Difficulty Class (DC).

*   **Magic:** Magic is handled through a system of spells and mana.

## Combat

During combat, characters take turns performing actions. Common actions include:

*   **Attack:** Make a melee or ranged attack against an opponent.
*   **Defend:** Focus on avoiding attacks.
*   **Cast Spell:** Cast a spell, consuming mana.
*   **Use Item:** Use an item from your inventory.

## Magic System

The magic system uses mana points to fuel spells. Each spell has a mana cost. Characters regain mana over time. Here's a simple example spell:

```
Spell Name: Fire Bolt
Mana Cost: 5
Effect: Deals 1d6 fire damage.
```

## Example Check

A character attempts to climb a wall. The GM (Game Master) sets the DC (Difficulty Class) to 15. The character has a Strength (Fuerza) of 8 (+1 modifier) and proficiency in Athletics (Atletismo) (+2 modifier).

The player rolls a d20 and gets a 12. They add their Strength (Fuerza) modifier (+1) and their Athletics (Atletismo) modifier (+2) for a total of 15. The check succeeds!

This is just a basic overview. The OpenFantasy system is designed to be customized and expanded upon. Have fun creating your own worlds and stories!
