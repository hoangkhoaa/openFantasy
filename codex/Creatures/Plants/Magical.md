# Welcome to the OpenFantasy RPG System!

This document outlines the core rules and mechanics for playing role-playing games (RPGs) using the OpenFantasy system. OpenFantasy is designed to be a flexible and customizable system, allowing Game Masters (游戏主持人) and players to create unique and engaging fantasy worlds.

## Core Concepts

*   **Attributes (属性):** Every character possesses a set of Attributes (属性) that define their inherent capabilities. Examples include Strength (力量), Dexterity (敏捷), Intelligence (智力), and Charisma (魅力).

*   **Skills (技能):** Skills (技能) represent learned abilities and proficiencies. Characters improve their Skills (技能) through training and experience. Examples include Athletics (运动), Stealth (潜行), Arcana (奥术), and Persuasion (说服).

*   **Checks (检定):** When a character attempts an action with an uncertain outcome, they make a Check (检定) by rolling a die and adding relevant Attributes (属性) and Skills (技能). The result is compared to a Difficulty Class (难度等级) (DC) to determine success or failure.

*   **Combat (战斗):** Combat (战斗) is resolved through a series of rounds, where characters take turns performing actions such as attacking, defending, and casting spells.

## Character Creation

Creating a character involves the following steps:

1.  **Choose a Race (选择种族):** Select a Race (种族) for your character. This determines your character's base Attributes (属性) and special abilities.
2.  **Assign Attributes (分配属性):** Assign values to your character's Attributes (属性).
3.  **Choose Skills (选择技能):** Select Skills (技能) that your character is proficient in.
4.  **Determine Equipment (确定装备):** Choose starting equipment for your character.
5.  **Develop Background (塑造背景):** Create a backstory and personality for your character.

## Example Character

| Race (种族) | Attribute (属性) | Value (数值) | Skills (技能) |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Humans (人类) | Strength (力量)    | 12       | Athletics (运动)  |
|             | Dexterity (敏捷)   | 14       | Stealth (潜行)    |
|             | Intelligence (智力) | 10       | Arcana (奥术)     |
|             | Charisma (魅力)   | 8        | Persuasion (说服) |

## Game Master (游戏主持人) Guidelines

The Game Master (游戏主持人) (GM) is responsible for creating and running the game. The GM:

*   Describes the game world and its inhabitants.
*   Presents challenges and encounters for the players.
*   Adjudicates rules and resolves conflicts.
