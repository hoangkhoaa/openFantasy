# Plants of OpenFantasy

> *"In the quiet language of root and leaf is written the oldest magic of our world."*

## Overview

The plant life of OpenFantasy represents a diverse and vital aspect of the world's ecosystem. From common crops that sustain civilizations to mystical flora with extraordinary properties, plants embody the subtle magic that permeates all living things.

Unlike the animal kingdom, plants typically possess minimal Soul component and vary widely in their Mana Capacity, with some species evolving to channel and store magical energy in unique ways. The elemental composition of plants—particularly their Mana component—directly influences their properties, growth patterns, and magical potential.

## Elemental Composition

Plants generally exhibit the following elemental composition ranges:

| Plant Category | Exanthis | Soul | Mana Capacity | Notes |
|----------------|----------|------|---------------|-------|
| Common Plants | 85-95% | 0-2% | 5-15% | Most standard flora |
| Medicinal Plants | 75-85% | 1-3% | 15-25% | Natural healing properties |
| Magical Plants | 60-80% | 1-5% | 20-40% | Innate magical attributes |
| Sentient Plants | 70-85% | 5-15% | 10-25% | Conscious plant entities |
