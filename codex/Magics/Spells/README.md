# **Spells Documentation Guide**

This directory contains documentation for the various spells available in the OpenFantasy world. Each spell is documented in a standardized format to ensure clarity and consistency.

## Spell Classification

Spells are organized into the following primary categories:

- **Elemental**: Spells that manipulate the primary elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, Shadow, Life, Death)
- **Utility**: Practical spells for everyday tasks and problem-solving
- **Protection**: Defensive magic that shields, wards, or counters hostile forces
- **Divination**: Spells that reveal information, enhance perception, or provide insight
- **Illusion**: Magic that creates false sensory impressions or alters perception
- **Enchantment**: Spells that imbue objects or beings with magical properties
- **Transformation**: Magic that changes the physical form or properties of targets
- **Summoning**: Spells that call creatures, entities, or objects from elsewhere

## Spell Documentation Components

Each spell document follows a standard structure with these components:

### Basic Information
- **Title and Brief Description**: The spell's name and a concise overview
- **Casting Information**: Difficulty level, casting time, duration, range, and components
- **Technical Details**: Mana types used, purity requirements, pattern complexity, etc.

### Technical Details Explained

The technical details section provides crucial information for spellcasters:

#### Mana Type Distribution

The proportions of different mana types required for the spell, such as:
- **Base Mana**: The foundational energy used in most spells
- **Elemental Mana Types**: Specialized energies (Pyromana, Hydromana, etc.)

For example: "Base Mana (60%), Umbramana (30%), Luxmana (10%)"

This indicates that to cast the spell successfully, a mage must:
1. Draw on their mana reserves
2. Separate the mana into these specific proportions
3. Maintain these proportions throughout the casting process

Different mana types contribute different properties to the spell:
- **Base Mana**: Provides structural stability and basic magical framework
- **Pyromana**: Contributes heat, energy, and transformative properties
- **Hydromana**: Adds fluidity, adaptability, and healing aspects
- **Terramana**: Provides solidity, permanence, and physical manifestation
- **Aeromana**: Contributes movement, freedom, and range
- **Luxmana**: Adds illumination, revelation, and purification
- **Umbramana**: Contributes concealment, subtlety, and psychological effects
- **Vitaemana**: Adds growth, healing, and enhancement
- **Mortismana**: Contributes decay, negation, and spiritual manipulation

#### Purity Requirements

The minimum level of mana purity required to successfully cast the spell:

| Purity Category | Percentage Range | Typical Spell Level |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Crude | 0-10% | Desperate emergency workings only |
| Basic | 10-35% | Novice spells |
| Refined | 35-65% | Adept spells |
| Superior | 65-85% | Expert spells |
| Perfect | 85-100% | Master and legendary spells |

Purity affects spell performance in several ways:
- **Below minimum**: Spell fails or produces unpredictable results
- **At minimum**: Spell functions but may be less effective or stable
- **Above minimum**: Spell gains enhanced effectiveness, precision, or duration

The purity requirement applies to each mana type involved in the spell. A caster must be able to purify each type of mana to at least the minimum percentage specified.

#### Purity Influence on Effect

Many spell documents include a section detailing how different purity levels affect the spell's performance. For example:

| Purity Level | Effect Enhancement |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 15-20% | Minimal effectiveness, barely functional |
| 20-35% | Standard effect as described in the main documentation |
| 35-50% | Enhanced effectiveness, duration, or precision |
| 50%+ | Maximum potential of the spell is achieved |

### Pattern Structure and Practical Effects

- **Pattern Structure**: The magical configuration that creates the spell effect
- **Practical Effect**: What the spell actually does when successfully cast
- **Limitations**: The boundaries and constraints of the spell's capabilities
- **Applications**: Common ways the spell is used in practical situations

### Variations and Learning

- **Variations**: Different versions or modifications of the basic spell
- **Risks and Miscast Effects**: What happens when the spell goes wrong
- **Learning Progression**: The typical path to mastering the spell
- **Historical Note**: Background on the spell's origin and development

## Relationship Between Spells and Character Development

As characters develop their magical abilities, they typically progress through spells in this order:

1. **Novice Spells**: Basic (10-35%) purity, simpler patterns, limited effects
2. **Adept Spells**: Refined (35-65%) purity, moderate complexity, expanded capabilities
3. **Expert Spells**: Superior (65-85%) purity, complex patterns, powerful effects
4. **Master Spells**: Perfect (85%+) purity, intricate patterns, extraordinary capabilities

Character advancement involves:
- Increasing mana capacity (larger reserves)
- Improving purification skills (higher quality)
- Learning more complex spell patterns (greater versatility)
- Specializing in particular mana types (enhanced effectiveness)

## Magical Research and Spell Creation

Experienced spellcasters can create new spells by:
1. Researching existing pattern structures
2. Experimenting with mana type proportions
3. Testing variations in practical applications
4. Refining and documenting successful configurations

New spell development requires thorough understanding of mana mechanics, extensive testing, and careful documentation to ensure safety and reliability.
