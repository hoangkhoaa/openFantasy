## Core Principles

Force Vector is a fundamental utility spell that converts pure mana into directional kinetic energy. Unlike elemental spells that manifest visible effects, Force Vector creates invisible lines of force that can push, pull, lift, or manipulate objects based on the caster's intent and the specific pattern variation employed.

The spell works by creating a resonant connection between the caster's mana and physical matter, allowing for the transfer of kinetic energy without direct physical contact. The core pattern establishes:

1. **Force Origin Point**: The anchor from which force emanates
2. **Vector Direction**: The precise angle and orientation of the force
3. **Intensity Matrix**: The strength and distribution of force along the vector
4. **Decay Function**: How quickly the force dissipates with distance

What distinguishes Force Vector from many other spells is its reliance on proper technique rather than high mana purity. Even practitioners with moderate purity levels can achieve remarkable results through disciplined training and precise execution. This makes it particularly popular among warriors and practical mages who may not have specialized in mana purification.

## Standard Variants

### Force Push
The most basic application, creating a directed push away from the caster:

Creates subtle force vectors to influence projectile trajectory:
- **Difficulty**: Advanced
- **Purity Requirement**: Refined (35-45%)
- **Effect**: Allows minor correction of projectile path after release
- **Typical Users**: Rangers, Scouts, Specialist Archers
- **Applications**: Guiding arrows around obstacles, compensating for wind, striking moving targets

### Multiple Vector Control
Establishes several force vectors simultaneously:
- **Difficulty**: Expert
- **Purity Requirement**: Refined to Perfect (45-60%)
- **Effect**: Controls 2-5 separate objects with independent force vectors
- **Typical Users**: Blade Dancers, Battle Mages, Duelists
- **Applications**: Floating weapon techniques, manipulating multiple objects, complex maneuvers

### Force Plane
Creates a sustained horizontal force vector field:
- **Difficulty**: Master
- **Purity Requirement**: Perfect (60-75%)
- **Effect**: Generates a planar force that can support weight
- **Typical Users**: High-level Mages, Advanced Practitioners
- **Applications**: Creating temporary bridges, floating platforms, emergency barriers

## Purity Influence on Effect

Unlike many spells, Force Vector depends more on technique and training than on mana purity. The relationship between capacity, technique, and object weight is more significant:

| Technique Level | Force Control | Maximum Weight | Efficiency |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Novice | Basic directional pushing/pulling | 5-10 pounds | Low (significant mana waste) |
| Practiced | Precise angles and consistent force | 10-50 pounds | Moderate (sustainable use) |
| Expert | Fine control with minimal effort | 50-200 pounds | High (approaches natural regeneration limit) |
| Master | Complex multi-vector manipulation | 200-500+ pounds | Excellent (maximizes natural regeneration) |

Most practitioners learn to work within their natural mana regeneration limits, utilizing roaming mana in the environment to supplement their own energy. This creates a sustainable equilibrium where they can maintain force effects for extended periods without exhaustion, provided they don't exceed their capacity threshold.

## Mana Capacity and Weight Relationship

The primary limiting factor in Force Vector manipulation is the relationship between mana capacity and object weight:

| Mana Capacity | Maximum Sustainable Weight | Duration at Maximum Weight |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 15-20% | Up to 50 pounds | Minutes (sustainable) |
| 21-30% | Up to 100 pounds | Minutes (sustainable) |
| 31-45% | Up to 250 pounds | Brief periods (limited sustainability) |
| 46-60% | Up to 500 pounds | Very brief (exceeds regeneration) |
| 61%+ | 500+ pounds | Momentary (quickly depletes reserves) |

Experienced users learn to operate at approximately 80-90% of their maximum capacity to maintain a balance between effectiveness and sustainability.

### Safety Practices
- Practicing with lightweight, non-fragile objects
- Beginning with horizontal vectors before vertical (gravity-affecting) applications

- Maintaining consistent somatic components for pattern stability

## Historical Development

Force Vector magic evolved from early battlefield techniques developed during the Second Age, when warriors sought advantages without relying on destructive elemental magic. The first systematic approach was documented by Battle-Mage Korvin, who developed the foundational "Three-Node Force Triangle" that remains the basis of modern vector casting.

What made this spell system revolutionary was its accessibility—unlike many magical disciplines that required high purity levels and extensive theoretical study, Force Vector could be effectively taught to soldiers and practical mages through focused physical training and repetitive practice exercises. This democratization of force manipulation magic changed the landscape of battlefield tactics and eventually spread to civilian applications.
