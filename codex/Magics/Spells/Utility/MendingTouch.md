# **Mending Touch**

A practical utility spell that repairs minor damage to small objects. Widely taught to apprentices across various magical disciplines, this spell demonstrates the principles of pattern restoration and material manipulation.

## Casting Information

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Difficulty** | Novice |
| **Casting Time** | 30 seconds |
| **Duration** | Instantaneous (repairs are permanent) |
| **Range** | Touch |
| **Components** | Somatic (tracing the break with fingers), Verbal (short phrase), Material (trace of the object's primary material) |

## Technical Details

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Mana Type** | Base Mana (60%), Terramana (30%), Vitaemana (10%) |
| **Purity Required** | Basic (15-30%) |
| **Pattern Complexity** | Simple (4 elements) |
| **Resonance Frequency** | Restoration/Cohesion spectrum |
| **Minimum Mana Capacity** | 20% (Higher capacity allows repair of more complex objects) |

## Pattern Structure

The Mending Touch pattern consists of four primary elements:
1. **Memory Node**: Captures the object's "memory" of its undamaged state
2. **Structure Web**: Analyzes and stabilizes the existing structure
3. **Material Flow**: Directs material elements to return to their proper configuration
4. **Binding Seal**: Permanently fixes the restored configuration in place

These elements form a diamond-shaped pattern that flows from the caster's hands into the damaged object.

## Practical Effect

When successfully cast, the spell:
- Reconnects broken pieces that are in contact with each other
- Seals small cracks and fissures
- Restores minor surface damage (scratches, scuffs, small chips)
- Returns the object to functional condition, though often with visible repair lines

## Limitations

- Works only on non-magical, non-living objects smaller than a breadbox
- Cannot restore missing pieces (all fragments must be present)
- Does not restore magical properties if the object once had them
- Not suitable for extremely complex or intricate mechanisms
- Visible "seams" remain at repair points, becoming less noticeable with caster skill

## Common Applications

- Repairing broken dishes, cups, and glassware
- Fixing torn pages in books
- Mending torn clothing or simple accessories
- Restoring broken tools to working condition
- Reattaching handles, knobs, or small decorative elements

## Variations

- **Seamless Mending**: An advanced variation that leaves no visible repair marks (Expert difficulty, 65-75% purity)
- **Swift Mend**: A faster version with reduced effectiveness (15 seconds casting, less durable repairs)
- **Remote Mending**: Allows repair without direct touch (Adept difficulty, 40-50% purity, requires clear line of sight)
- **Material Focus**: Specialized versions optimized for specific materials (wood, cloth, ceramic, etc.)

## Risks and Miscast Effects

- **False Joining**: Pieces fuse incorrectly, resulting in a warped or unusable object
- **Temporary Repair**: Poor casting or insufficient purity (below 15%) creates a repair that holds for only a few hours before failing
- **Surface Marring**: Failed casting leaves discoloration or texture changes on the object
- **Material Stress**: Creates invisible weaknesses that may cause the object to break again under strain
- **Pattern Rebound**: Critical purity shortage (below 10%) may cause the broken pieces to repel each other, potentially causing minor injuries

## Purity Influence on Effect

| Purity Level | Effect Enhancement |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 10-15% | Temporary repairs that last hours to days at most |
| 15-30% | Standard effect as described above, visible repair lines |
| 30-50% | Less visible repair lines, stronger bonds, can fix slightly more complex objects |
| 50%+ | Nearly invisible repair seams, can restore minor missing material (chips, etc.) |

## Musical Analogy

Mending Touch is like tuning an instrument that has gone slightly out of tune. The caster must identify the proper "note" (the object's undamaged state) and carefully adjust the "strings" (material structure) until they once again produce harmony. Just as a precisely tuned instrument resonates with clarity, a properly mended object regains its structural integrity.

## Learning Progression

Most students master this spell through practice on increasingly challenging materials:
1. **Paper and Fabrics**: Simple, forgiving materials
2. **Wood and Ceramics**: More structure, requiring greater precision
3. **Glass and Stone**: Dense materials that resist magical influence
4. **Complex Objects**: Items with multiple materials or moving parts

## Historical Note

The first standardized version of Mending Touch was developed by Elven household mages of the Third Era who sought to create a practical spell accessible to those with minimal magical training. Initially dismissed by "serious" magical academics as mere housekeeping magic, the spell's elegant efficiency and practical utility eventually earned it a place in standard magical curricula. Today, it is often cited as a perfect example of magical design principles: maximum utility with minimal complexity.
