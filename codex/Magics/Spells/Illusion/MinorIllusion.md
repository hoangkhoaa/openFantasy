# **Minor Illusion**

> *"Reality is but a canvas awaiting the illusion artist's touch."*  
> â€” Mirala Shadowweaver, Illusion Grandmaster

## Casting Information
- **Difficulty**: Novice
- **Casting Time**: 2 seconds
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 5 minutes
- **Range**: Within 15 feet
- **Components**: Somatic, Verbal

## Technical Details
- **Mana Type Distribution**: Base Mana 60%, Umbramana 30%, Luxmana 10%
- **Purity Required**: Basic (15-25%)
- **Minimum Mana Capacity**: 15% (Higher capacity extends possible duration and area)
- **Pattern Complexity**: Simple (3-tier matrix)
- **Resonance Frequency**: Mid-range sensory spectrum

## Pattern Structure

The spell consists of four primary pattern elements forming a sensory projection matrix:

1. **Image Seed**: The core visualization pattern that establishes the illusion's foundation
2. **Sensory Projection**: The pattern component that projects the illusion into physical space
3. **Boundary Frame**: Defines the spatial limitations and edges of the illusion
4. **Perception Hook**: The subtle pattern that connects the illusion to observers' senses

## Practical Effect

Minor Illusion creates a single sensory illusion within range:
- A visual illusion no larger than a 5-foot cube
- A sound emanating from a point in range (whisper to conversation volume)
- A simple scent detectable within 10 feet
- A minor tactile sensation (temperature change, light breeze, gentle touch)

The spell can create only one type of sensory effect at a time. The illusion has no physical substance and cannot cause damage, create light that illuminates areas, or produce sound loud enough to cause damage or be heard more than 100 feet away.

## Purity Influence on Effect

The caster's mana purity directly affects the illusion's quality, believability, and stability:

| Purity Level | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| Below 10% | Casting typically fails; any resulting illusion appears as obvious magical energy with no coherent form |
| 10-15% | Highly unstable illusion with visible fluctuations and mana "glitches"; immediately recognizable as magical |
| 15-25% | Standard illusion that appears realistic from a distance but lacks fine details and natural movement |
| 25-35% | Enhanced illusion with improved details, more natural movement, and better sensory integration |
| 35-45% | Refined illusion with convincing details that can withstand moderate scrutiny; subtle environmental interaction |
| 50%+ | Nearly flawless illusion that can fool most observers without careful inspection; seamlessly adapts to environmental changes |

Higher purity also extends potential duration, reduces concentration strain, and minimizes the risk of Wild Mana contamination which can cause unintended sensory effects to bleed into the illusion.

## Common Applications

- **Distraction**: Creating sounds or visual distractions to divert attention
- **Concealment**: Masking small objects or features with illusory coverings
- **Communication**: Displaying simple messages or warnings
- **Entertainment**: Creating pleasant visuals or sounds for amusement
- **Ambiance**: Enhancing environments with appropriate sensory elements
- **Pranks**: Harmless tricks and surprises (heavily discouraged in academic settings)

## Variations

| Variation | Effect | Requirements |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Silent Image** | Visual illusion only, but with enhanced detail | Standard casting, focus on visual component |
| **Whisper** | Sound-only version with greater range (30 feet) | Standard casting, focus on auditory component |
| **Phantom Scent** | Olfactory illusion with increased intensity and complexity | Standard casting, focus on olfactory component |
| **Ghost Touch** | Tactile illusion with more complex sensation patterns | Standard casting, focus on tactile component |
| **Persistent Image** | Lasts without concentration for 1 minute | 25%+ purity and increased mana expenditure |
| **Dual Sense** | Combines two sensory effects simultaneously | 35%+ purity and 20%+ mana capacity |

## Risks and Miscast Effects

| Risk | Effect | Cause |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Sensory Bleed** | Unintended secondary sensory effects | Imprecise pattern formation |
| **Pattern Collapse** | Illusion dissipates prematurely | Insufficient concentration |
| **Perception Lock** | Caster temporarily experiences the illusion as real | Wild Mana contamination above 15% |
| **Sensory Echo** | Illusion repeats at random intervals after dismissal | Improper spell termination |
| **Detail Drift** | Illusion details gradually change without caster input | Purity below 15% or Wild Mana interference |
| **Reality Distortion** | Caster's perception of real sensory input becomes temporarily distorted | Critical purity shortage (below 10%) |

## Musical Analogy

Casting Minor Illusion is like playing a simple melody that listeners can perceive but not interact with. The caster must maintain the rhythm (concentration) to keep the melody playing, while carefully balancing the various sensory "notes" to create a convincing performance. Wild Mana contamination introduces random discordant notes that diminish the performance quality.

## Learning Progression

1. **Pattern Formation**: Learning to create and maintain the basic illusion pattern
2. **Sensory Clarity**: Refining the illusion to appear more realistic and detailed
3. **Sustaining Focus**: Extending the duration through improved concentration
4. **Complexity Development**: Adding subtle details and natural movements
5. **Adaptation**: Learning to modify the illusion in response to environment
6. **Purification Techniques**: Methods to reduce Wild Mana contamination for clearer illusions

## Historical Note

Minor Illusion was developed by Mirala Shadowweaver during the Second Age as a teaching tool for apprentice illusionists. The spell's simple structure makes it an ideal introduction to perception manipulation, while its limited scope prevents dangerous applications. It remains one of the most commonly taught spells in magical academies across the realm.
