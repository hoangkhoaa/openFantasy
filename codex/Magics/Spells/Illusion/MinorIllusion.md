## Mana Mechanics

### Base Mana Function
The Base Mana component (60%) provides:
- Structural framework for the illusion pattern
- Stability and duration maintenance
- Connection to the caster's concentration
- Boundary definition and spatial anchoring

### Umbramana Function
The Shadow mana component (30%) contributes:
- Visual/sensory obscuration capabilities
- Reality distortion properties
- Light/perception manipulation
- Concealment of the magical nature of the effect

### Luxmana Function
The Light mana component (10%) provides:
- Visual clarity and detail enhancement
- Sensory precision and definition
- Reality mimicry qualities
- Observer connection hooks

### Specialization Process
The caster must successfully:
1. Draw Base Mana from internal reserves
2. Transform approximately 40% of this Base Mana into specialized forms
3. Maintain the correct proportional balance (60:30:10)
4. Establish the harmonics between opposing elements (Umbramana and Luxmana)

## Pattern Structure

The spell consists of four primary pattern elements forming a sensory projection matrix:

1. **Image Seed**: The core visualization pattern that establishes the illusion's foundation
2. **Sensory Projection**: The pattern component that projects the illusion into physical space
3. **Boundary Frame**: Defines the spatial limitations and edges of the illusion
4. **Perception Hook**: The subtle pattern that connects the illusion to observers' senses

## Practical Effect

Minor Illusion creates a single sensory illusion within range:
- A visual illusion no larger than a 5-foot cube
- A sound emanating from a point in range (whisper to conversation volume)
- A simple scent detectable within 10 feet
- A minor tactile sensation (temperature change, light breeze, gentle touch)

The spell can create only one type of sensory effect at a time. The illusion has no physical substance and cannot cause damage, create light that illuminates areas, or produce sound loud enough to cause damage or be heard more than 100 feet away.

## Purity Influence on Effect

The caster's mana purity directly affects the illusion's quality, believability, and stability:

| Purity Level | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| Below 10% | Casting typically fails; any resulting illusion appears as obvious magical energy with no coherent form |
| 10-15% | Highly unstable illusion with visible fluctuations and mana "glitches"; immediately recognizable as magical |
| 15-25% | Standard illusion that appears realistic from a distance but lacks fine details and natural movement |
| 25-35% | Enhanced illusion with improved details, more natural movement, and better sensory integration |
| 35-45% | Refined illusion with convincing details that can withstand moderate scrutiny; subtle environmental interaction |
| 50%+ | Nearly flawless illusion that can fool most observers without careful inspection; seamlessly adapts to environmental changes |

Higher purity also extends potential duration, reduces concentration strain, and minimizes the risk of Wild Mana contamination which can cause unintended sensory effects to bleed into the illusion.

## Mana Capacity Effects

The caster's Mana Capacity influences the spell in several ways:

| Capacity Level | Duration Effect | Size/Range Effect | Quality Effect |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 15-25% | Basic duration (up to 5 minutes) | Standard range (15 feet) | Standard quality |
| 25-40% | Extended duration (up to 10 minutes) | Increased range (20 feet) | Minor detail enhancement |
| 40-60% | Long duration (up to 20 minutes) | Extended range (25 feet) | Significant detail enhancement |
| 60%+ | Sustained duration (up to 30 minutes) | Maximum range (30 feet) | Maximum detail potential |

## Common Applications

- **Distraction**: Creating sounds or visual distractions to divert attention
- **Concealment**: Masking small objects or features with illusory coverings
- **Communication**: Displaying simple messages or warnings
- **Entertainment**: Creating pleasant visuals or sounds for amusement
- **Ambiance**: Enhancing environments with appropriate sensory elements
- **Pranks**: Harmless tricks and surprises (heavily discouraged in academic settings)

## Variations

| Variation | Effect | Mana Requirements |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Silent Image** | Visual illusion only, but with enhanced detail | 65% Base Mana, 25% Umbramana, 10% Luxmana |
| **Whisper** | Sound-only version with greater range (30 feet) | 70% Base Mana, 20% Umbramana, 10% Aeromana |
| **Phantom Scent** | Olfactory illusion with increased intensity | 60% Base Mana, 25% Umbramana, 15% Vitamana |
| **Ghost Touch** | Tactile illusion with more complex sensation | 55% Base Mana, 35% Umbramana, 10% Terramana |
| **Persistent Image** | Lasts without concentration for 1 minute | 50% Base Mana, 25% Umbramana, 15% Luxmana, 10% Chronomana; 25%+ purity required |
| **Dual Sense** | Combines two sensory effects simultaneously | 45% Base Mana, 35% Umbramana, 20% Luxmana; 35%+ purity and 20%+ capacity required |

## Risks and Miscast Effects

| Risk | Effect | Cause |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Sensory Bleed** | Unintended secondary sensory effects | Imprecise specialization, Base Mana deficiency |
| **Pattern Collapse** | Illusion dissipates prematurely | Insufficient concentration, unstable Base Mana framework |
| **Perception Lock** | Caster temporarily experiences the illusion as real | Wild Mana contamination above 15%, improper Umbramana balance |
| **Sensory Echo** | Illusion repeats at random intervals after dismissal | Improper spell termination, excess Chronomana resonance |
| **Detail Drift** | Illusion details gradually change without caster input | Purity below 15% or Wild Mana interference with Luxmana component |
| **Reality Distortion** | Caster's perception of real sensory input becomes temporarily distorted | Critical purity shortage (below 10%), excessive Umbramana specialization |

## Elemental Interactions

Minor Illusion demonstrates several important elemental principles:

1. **Balanced Opposition**: The controlled tension between Umbramana (shadow) and Luxmana (light) creates the realistic visual quality
2. **Base Mana Framework**: The high proportion of Base Mana (60%) provides stability for the inherently unstable combination of opposed elements
3. **Harmonic Resonance**: The specific 60:30:10 ratio creates a resonance pattern that mimics natural sensory frequencies
4. **Specialization Gradient**: The spell uses partially specialized Umbramana and Luxmana rather than pure forms, allowing more subtle effects

## Musical Analogy

Casting Minor Illusion is like playing a simple melody that listeners can perceive but not interact with. The Base Mana forms the fundamental tone or "carrier note," while the Umbramana and Luxmana create the harmonics that give the illusion its character. The caster must maintain the rhythm (concentration) to keep the melody playing, while carefully balancing the various sensory "notes" to create a convincing performance. Wild Mana contamination introduces random discordant notes that diminish the performance quality.

## Learning Progression

1. **Base Mana Structure**: Learning to create and maintain the basic illusion framework
2. **Umbramana Specialization**: Developing skill in shadow mana conversion for reality distortion
3. **Luxmana Integration**: Adding light mana elements for detail and clarity
4. **Harmonic Balancing**: Achieving the precise ratio of elements for stable illusions
5. **Sensory Precision**: Refining the illusion to appear more realistic and detailed
6. **Sustaining Focus**: Extending the duration through improved concentration
7. **Purification Techniques**: Methods to reduce Wild Mana contamination for clearer illusions

## Historical Note

Minor Illusion was developed by Mirala Shadowweaver during the Second Age as a teaching tool for apprentice illusionists. The spell's simple structure makes it an ideal introduction to perception manipulation, while its limited scope prevents dangerous applications. It remains one of the most commonly taught spells in magical academies across the realm.
