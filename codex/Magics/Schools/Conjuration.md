# **The School of Conjuration** (通灵学院)

> *"To conjure is to reach across the veil of possibility and draw forth that which exists elsewhere. It is not creation, but connection—a bridge between realms."*

## Overview (概述)

Conjuration (通灵术) is the school of magic focused on calling forth matter, energy, or entities from elsewhere—whether from another location in the material world, elemental planes (元素位面), or even other dimensions. Unlike illusion (幻术) that creates sensory deception or evocation (塑能术) that generates effects from raw magical energy, conjuration (通灵术) involves the transportation, manifestation (显现), or binding (束缚) of pre-existing elements. It is considered one of the most potentially dangerous magical disciplines due to its interaction with forces and entities beyond the caster's native realm.

## Fundamental Principles (基本原则)

### The Correspondence Axiom (对应公理)

The foundation of conjuration (通灵术) theory is the Correspondence Axiom (对应公理), which states that all things that exist share fundamental resonant patterns that can be leveraged to create connections across space, time, and dimensional boundaries. By replicating these patterns, conjurers (通灵师) can establish temporary or permanent links between distant points.

### Primary Components (主要组成部分)

All conjuration (通灵术) spells incorporate three fundamental components:

1. **Pattern Recognition** (模式识别): Identifying the specific resonant signature of the target
2. **Spatial Bridging** (空间桥接): Creating a connection between the caster's location and the target's location
3. **Manifestation Control** (显现控制): Guiding and containing the conjured element upon arrival

More complex conjurations add additional components:

4. **Binding Frameworks** (束缚框架): Establishing control over conjured entities
5. **Duration Anchoring** (持续时间锚定): Extending the manifestation period beyond immediate casting
6. **Return Protocols** (返回协议): Methods for dismissing or returning conjured elements

### Mana Requirements (法力需求)

Conjuration (通灵术) requires specific combinations of mana types, with purity levels that increase with the complexity and distance of the conjuration:

| Conjuration Type (通灵类型) | Primary Mana (主要法力) | Secondary Mana (次要法力) | Tertiary Mana (第三法力) | Purpose (目的) |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Object Summoning (物体召唤) | Base Mana (基础法力) (40-50%) | Terramana (大地法力) (20-30%) | N/A | Material objects (物质物体) |
| Elemental Calling (元素召唤) | Base Mana (基础法力) (50-60%) | Elemental type (元素类型) (30-40%) | N/A | Elemental forces (元素力量) |
| Entity Summoning (实体召唤) | Base Mana (基础法力) (60-70%) | Varies by entity (因实体而异) | Aetheramana (以太法力) (10-20%) | Living beings (生物) |
| Teleportation (传送) | Base Mana (基础法力) (50-60%) | Chronosmana (时间法力) (20-30%) | Aetheramana (以太法力) (10-20%) | Self/object movement (自身/物体移动) |
| Extradimensional Space (异次元空间) | Base Mana (基础法力) (60-70%) | Aetheramana (以太法力) (20-30%) | Chronosmana (时间法力) (10-20%) | Pocket dimensions (口袋维度) |
| Planar Gateway (位面传送门) | Base Mana (基础法力) (70-80%) | Aetheramana (以太法力) (40-50%) | Varies by plane (因位面而异) | Interplanar travel (位面旅行) |

### Wild Mana Response (狂野法力反应)

Conjuration (通灵术) magic has a complex relationship with Wild Mana (狂野法力). While controlled conjuration (通灵术) requires precise patterns, Wild Mana (狂野法力) can actually enhance certain types of summoning by:

- **Boundary Weakening** (边界弱化): Making it easier to reach across planar boundaries
- **Manifestation Boosting** (显现增强): Providing additional energy for materialization
- **Pattern Expansion** (模式扩展): Allowing for less exact correspondent patterns to succeed

However, these benefits come with significant risks:

- **Location Drift** (位置偏移): Conjured elements may arrive from unexpected sources
- **Partial Manifestation** (部分显现): Incomplete or distorted summoning results
- **Binding Failure** (束缚失败): Loss of control over conjured entities or elements
- **Reverse Flow** (反向流动): The caster being pulled toward the target rather than vice versa

## Mana Purification for Conjuration (通灵术的法力净化)

Conjuration (通灵术) requires high mana purity for precise targeting and control:

| Purification Level (净化等级) | Conjuration Capability (通灵能力) |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Basic (基础) (15-25%) | Simple object summoning from visible locations (从可见位置简单召唤物体) |
| Intermediate (中级) (30-45%) | Elemental calling and teleportation of small objects over moderate distances (元素召唤和短距离的小物体传送) |
| Advanced (高级) (50-65%) | Entity summoning, personal teleportation, and minor extradimensional spaces (实体召唤、个人传送和小型异次元空间) |
| Master (大师) (70-80%) | Complex entity binding, group teleportation, and stable pocket dimensions (复杂实体束缚、群体传送和稳定的口袋维度) |
| Grandmaster (宗师) (85%+) | Planar gateways and permanent extradimensional constructs (位面传送门和永久异次元结构) |

Insufficient purity in conjuration (通灵术) often results in material or spatial distortion—objects arriving damaged, locations being slightly misaligned, or entities appearing with altered properties.

## The Conjurer's Harmony (通灵师的和谐)

Conjuration (通灵术) magic is conceptualized through musical counterpoint, with each spell creating harmonic relationships between source and destination:

- **Unison** (同音): Direct transportation with minimal change
- **Octave Shift** (八度音移): Scaling effects (enlarging or diminishing the conjured element)
- **Harmonization** (和谐化): Adapting the conjured element to its new environment
- **Dissonant Conjuring** (不和谐通灵): Forcing incompatible elements into manifestation
- **Resonant Summoning** (共鸣召唤): Enhanced manifestation through matching harmonics

Master conjurers (通灵大师) speak of "conducting" multiple simultaneous manifestations, maintaining distinct harmonic relationships with each conjured element.

## Specialized Disciplines (专业学科)

### Summoning (召唤)

The calling of entities, whether elemental, spiritual, or organic. Practitioners are known as Summoners (召唤师).

### Material Conjuration (物质通灵)

Focused on manifesting non-living objects and substances. Masters are called Materializers (物质化者).

### Spatial Manipulation (空间操纵)

Specialized in teleportation and dimensional pockets. Practitioners are called Spatials (空间师).

### Binding (束缚)

The control and constraint of conjured entities. Masters are known as Binders (束缚者).

### Gateway Creation (传送门创造)

Establishing permanent or semi-permanent connections between locations. Practitioners are called Gateweavers (传送门编织者).

### Dismissal (驱逐)

Specialized in returning conjured elements to their origin. Masters are known as Banishers (驱逐者).

### Planar Exploration (位面探索)

The study and access of other planes of existence. Practitioners are called Planeswalkers (位面行者).

## Training Methodology (训练方法)

Conjuration (通灵术) training follows a structured progression:

1. **Theoretical Foundations** (理论基础): Understanding cross-spatial relationships and correspondence
2. **Local Manifestation** (本地显现): Practicing with objects in visual range
3. **Distance Expansion** (距离扩展): Gradually increasing the range of conjuration
4. **Elemental Work** (元素工作): Summoning the more predictable elemental forces
5. **Dimensional Theory** (维度理论): Study of other planes and dimensions
6. **Entity Protocols** (实体协议): Safe summoning and binding of sentient beings
7. **Self-Translation** (自我传送): Personal teleportation techniques
8. **Combined Operations** (联合行动): Managing multiple conjurations simultaneously

Training emphasizes control and containment above all else, with rigorous safety protocols developed from centuries of sometimes catastrophic failures.

## Conjuration in Practice (通灵术实践)

The process of casting conjuration (通灵术) magic follows distinct phases:

1. **Target Identification** (目标识别): Determining the specific element to be conjured
2. **Pattern Matching** (模式匹配): Establishing the resonant link to the target
3. **Mana Purification** (法力净化): Achieving the necessary purity for stable connections
4. **Boundary Thinning** (边界稀释): Creating the spatial or dimensional pathway
5. **Draw or Push** (拉或推): Pulling the target to the caster or moving the caster to the target
6. **Manifestation Stabilization** (显现稳定): Anchoring the conjured element in its new location
7. **Binding (if needed)** (束缚（如果需要）): Establishing control over conjured entities
8. **Dismissal Preparation** (驱逐准备): Setting conditions for ending the conjuration

For emergency conjuration (通灵术), these steps may be compressed into rapid casting, while complex summonings often involve elaborate ritual circles and extended preparation.

## Practical Applications (实际应用)

Conjuration (通灵术) serves numerous practical functions in magical society:

- **Transportation** (运输): Personal and group teleportation networks, item delivery systems
- **Resource Acquisition** (资源获取): Summoning rare materials from distant locations
- **Space Optimization** (空间优化): Extradimensional storage for homes, businesses, and archives
- **Emergency Services** (紧急服务): Rapid response through teleportation, summoning water for firefighting
- **Construction** (建造): Conjuring building materials directly at construction sites
- **Military** (军事): Strategic troop deployment, supply line maintenance, battlefield control
- **Entertainment** (娱乐): Conjuration performances featuring exotic entities or spectacular manifestations

## Ethical Considerations (伦理考量)

Conjuration (通灵术) raises significant ethical questions:

- **Entity Rights** (实体权利): The moral implications of summoning and binding sentient beings
- **Ecosystem Impact** (生态系统影响): Consequences of removing elements from their native environments
- **Dimensional Stability** (维度稳定性): Potential harm from weakening planar boundaries
- **Informed Consent** (知情同意): Whether entities understand or agree to being summoned
- **Environmental Exploitation** (环境剥削): Using conjuration to extract resources from vulnerable regions
- **Secure Transport** (安全运输): Privacy and security concerns with teleportation networks

Most conjuration (通灵术) academies enforce strict ethical codes governing entity summoning and extradimensional access.

## Limitations and Weaknesses (局限性和弱点)

Despite its power, conjuration (通灵术) has inherent limitations:

- **Conservation Principles** (守恒定律): Matter and energy can be moved but not created from nothing
- **Correspondence Requirements** (对应要求): Conjurers (通灵师) must have some connection to or knowledge of their target
- **Distance Factors** (距离因素): Energy requirements increase exponentially with distance or dimensional separation
- **Unwilling Resistance** (不情愿的抵抗): Sentient targets can resist summoning or teleportation
- **Planar Compatibility** (位面兼容性): Some elements cannot exist in environments too different from their origin
- **Dimensional Rejection** (维度排斥): Repeated conjuration to the same location can create instability

Common countermeasures against conjuration (通灵术) include:

- **Anchor Wards** (锚定结界): Magical protections that prevent teleportation or summoning
- **Pattern Obscuring** (模式模糊): Techniques to hide one's resonant signature from would-be summoners
- **Dimensional Shielding** (维度屏蔽): Barriers that block access from other planes
- **Binding Severing** (束缚切断): Methods to break control over summoned entities
- **Return Forcing** (强制返回): Compelling conjured elements to return to their origin prematurely

## Musical Analogy (音乐类比)

In the musical framework of magic, conjuration (通灵术) represents string instruments—creating connections that vibrate across distances, pulling disparate elements into harmony. The conjurer (通灵师) is like a harpist, plucking the strings that connect different points in the multiverse.

Conjuration (通灵术) spells are described in terms of "resonance" and "harmonics," with each successful manifestation requiring perfect tuning between the caster and target. Master conjurers (通灵大师) can maintain complex "chords" of multiple connections simultaneously, drawing elements from various sources into carefully orchestrated combinations.

## Notable Practitioners (著名实践者)

- **Thaddeus Voidcaller** (萨迪厄斯·虚空召唤者): Pioneer of safe entity summoning protocols and creator of the Sevenfold Binding Circle (七重束缚法阵)
- **Lydia Gateheart** (莉迪亚·传送门之心): Established the first permanent teleportation network spanning the continent
- **Corvus Dimensionum** (科尔乌斯·维度): Legendary explorer of pocket dimensions and creator of the Pocket Academy (口袋学院)
- **Elara Quicksilver** (艾拉拉·快银): Master of combat teleportation and developer of the Spatial Combat System (空间战斗系统)
- **Malachi Netherbridge** (马拉奇·冥桥): Controversial researcher who established first contact with the Far Realms (遥远领域)

## Safety Protocols (安全协议)

Due to the inherent dangers of conjuration (通灵术), standardized safety measures include:

- **Containment Circles** (封锁法阵): Mandatory for all entity summoning
- **Pattern Verification** (模式验证): Double-checking correspondences before casting
- **Emergency Dismissal Words** (紧急驱逐语): Universal phrases taught to instantly end conjurations
- **Planar Anchoring** (位面锚定): Methods to prevent unwanted dimensional drift
- **Entity Contracts** (实体契约): Formal agreements with regularly summoned beings
- **Observation Partners** (观察伙伴): Required second casters for monitoring complex conjurations

The Conjurer's Oath (通灵师誓言), taken by all certified practitioners, includes the promise to "never call what cannot be dismissed, never bind what cannot be controlled, and never open doors that cannot be closed."
