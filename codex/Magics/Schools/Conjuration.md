# **The School of Conjuration**

> *"To conjure is to reach across the veil of possibility and draw forth that which exists elsewhere. It is not creation, but connection—a bridge between realms."*  
> — Archconjurer Thaddeus Voidcaller, Master of the Summoning Circle

## Overview

Conjuration is the school of magic focused on calling forth matter, energy, or entities from elsewhere—whether from another location in the material world, elemental planes, or even other dimensions. Unlike illusion that creates sensory deception or evocation that generates effects from raw magical energy, conjuration involves the transportation, manifestation, or binding of pre-existing elements. It is considered one of the most potentially dangerous magical disciplines due to its interaction with forces and entities beyond the caster's native realm.

## Fundamental Principles

### The Correspondence Axiom

The foundation of conjuration theory is the Correspondence Axiom, which states that all things that exist share fundamental resonant patterns that can be leveraged to create connections across space, time, and dimensional boundaries. By replicating these patterns, conjurers can establish temporary or permanent links between distant points.

### Primary Components

All conjuration spells incorporate three fundamental components:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying the specific resonant signature of the target
2. **Spatial Bridging**: Creating a connection between the caster's location and the target's location
3. **Manifestation Control**: Guiding and containing the conjured element upon arrival

More complex conjurations add additional components:

4. **Binding Frameworks**: Establishing control over conjured entities
5. **Duration Anchoring**: Extending the manifestation period beyond immediate casting
6. **Return Protocols**: Methods for dismissing or returning conjured elements

### Mana Requirements

Conjuration requires specific combinations of mana types, with purity levels that increase with the complexity and distance of the conjuration:

| Conjuration Type | Primary Mana | Secondary Mana | Tertiary Mana | Purpose |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Object Summoning | Base Mana (40-50%) | Terramana (20-30%) | N/A | Material objects |
| Elemental Calling | Base Mana (50-60%) | Elemental type (30-40%) | N/A | Elemental forces |
| Entity Summoning | Base Mana (60-70%) | Varies by entity | Aetheramana (10-20%) | Living beings |
| Teleportation | Base Mana (50-60%) | Chronosmana (20-30%) | Aetheramana (10-20%) | Self/object movement |
| Extradimensional Space | Base Mana (60-70%) | Aetheramana (20-30%) | Chronosmana (10-20%) | Pocket dimensions |
| Planar Gateway | Base Mana (70-80%) | Aetheramana (40-50%) | Varies by plane | Interplanar travel |

### Wild Mana Response

Conjuration magic has a complex relationship with Wild Mana. While controlled conjuration requires precise patterns, Wild Mana can actually enhance certain types of summoning by:

- **Boundary Weakening**: Making it easier to reach across planar boundaries
- **Manifestation Boosting**: Providing additional energy for materialization
- **Pattern Expansion**: Allowing for less exact correspondent patterns to succeed

However, these benefits come with significant risks:

- **Location Drift**: Conjured elements may arrive from unexpected sources
- **Partial Manifestation**: Incomplete or distorted summoning results
- **Binding Failure**: Loss of control over conjured entities or elements
- **Reverse Flow**: The caster being pulled toward the target rather than vice versa

## Mana Purification for Conjuration

Conjuration requires high mana purity for precise targeting and control:

| Purification Level | Conjuration Capability |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Basic (15-25%) | Simple object summoning from visible locations |
| Intermediate (30-45%) | Elemental calling and teleportation of small objects over moderate distances |
| Advanced (50-65%) | Entity summoning, personal teleportation, and minor extradimensional spaces |
| Master (70-80%) | Complex entity binding, group teleportation, and stable pocket dimensions |
| Grandmaster (85%+) | Planar gateways and permanent extradimensional constructs |

Insufficient purity in conjuration often results in material or spatial distortion—objects arriving damaged, locations being slightly misaligned, or entities appearing with altered properties.

## The Conjurer's Harmony

Conjuration magic is conceptualized through musical counterpoint, with each spell creating harmonic relationships between source and destination:

- **Unison**: Direct transportation with minimal change
- **Octave Shift**: Scaling effects (enlarging or diminishing the conjured element)
- **Harmonization**: Adapting the conjured element to its new environment
- **Dissonant Conjuring**: Forcing incompatible elements into manifestation
- **Resonant Summoning**: Enhanced manifestation through matching harmonics

Master conjurers speak of "conducting" multiple simultaneous manifestations, maintaining distinct harmonic relationships with each conjured element.

## Specialized Disciplines

### Summoning

The calling of entities, whether elemental, spiritual, or organic. Practitioners are known as Summoners.

### Material Conjuration

Focused on manifesting non-living objects and substances. Masters are called Materializers.

### Spatial Manipulation

Specialized in teleportation and dimensional pockets. Practitioners are called Spatials.

### Binding

The control and constraint of conjured entities. Masters are known as Binders.

### Gateway Creation

Establishing permanent or semi-permanent connections between locations. Practitioners are called Gateweavers.

### Dismissal

Specialized in returning conjured elements to their origin. Masters are known as Banishers.

### Planar Exploration

The study and access of other planes of existence. Practitioners are called Planeswalkers.

## Training Methodology

Conjuration training follows a structured progression:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding cross-spatial relationships and correspondence
2. **Local Manifestation**: Practicing with objects in visual range
3. **Distance Expansion**: Gradually increasing the range of conjuration
4. **Elemental Work**: Summoning the more predictable elemental forces
5. **Dimensional Theory**: Study of other planes and dimensions
6. **Entity Protocols**: Safe summoning and binding of sentient beings
7. **Self-Translation**: Personal teleportation techniques
8. **Combined Operations**: Managing multiple conjurations simultaneously

Training emphasizes control and containment above all else, with rigorous safety protocols developed from centuries of sometimes catastrophic failures.

## Conjuration in Practice

The process of casting conjuration magic follows distinct phases:

1. **Target Identification**: Determining the specific element to be conjured
2. **Pattern Matching**: Establishing the resonant link to the target
3. **Mana Purification**: Achieving the necessary purity for stable connections
4. **Boundary Thinning**: Creating the spatial or dimensional pathway
5. **Draw or Push**: Pulling the target to the caster or moving the caster to the target
6. **Manifestation Stabilization**: Anchoring the conjured element in its new location
7. **Binding (if needed)**: Establishing control over conjured entities
8. **Dismissal Preparation**: Setting conditions for ending the conjuration

For emergency conjuration, these steps may be compressed into rapid casting, while complex summonings often involve elaborate ritual circles and extended preparation.

## Practical Applications

Conjuration serves numerous practical functions in magical society:

- **Transportation**: Personal and group teleportation networks, item delivery systems
- **Resource Acquisition**: Summoning rare materials from distant locations
- **Space Optimization**: Extradimensional storage for homes, businesses, and archives
- **Emergency Services**: Rapid response through teleportation, summoning water for firefighting
- **Construction**: Conjuring building materials directly at construction sites
- **Military**: Strategic troop deployment, supply line maintenance, battlefield control
- **Entertainment**: Conjuration performances featuring exotic entities or spectacular manifestations

## Ethical Considerations

Conjuration raises significant ethical questions:

- **Entity Rights**: The moral implications of summoning and binding sentient beings
- **Ecosystem Impact**: Consequences of removing elements from their native environments
- **Dimensional Stability**: Potential harm from weakening planar boundaries
- **Informed Consent**: Whether entities understand or agree to being summoned
- **Environmental Exploitation**: Using conjuration to extract resources from vulnerable regions
- **Secure Transport**: Privacy and security concerns with teleportation networks

Most conjuration academies enforce strict ethical codes governing entity summoning and extradimensional access.

## Limitations and Weaknesses

Despite its power, conjuration has inherent limitations:

- **Conservation Principles**: Matter and energy can be moved but not created from nothing
- **Correspondence Requirements**: Conjurers must have some connection to or knowledge of their target
- **Distance Factors**: Energy requirements increase exponentially with distance or dimensional separation
- **Unwilling Resistance**: Sentient targets can resist summoning or teleportation
- **Planar Compatibility**: Some elements cannot exist in environments too different from their origin
- **Dimensional Rejection**: Repeated conjuration to the same location can create instability

Common countermeasures against conjuration include:

- **Anchor Wards**: Magical protections that prevent teleportation or summoning
- **Pattern Obscuring**: Techniques to hide one's resonant signature from would-be summoners
- **Dimensional Shielding**: Barriers that block access from other planes
- **Binding Severing**: Methods to break control over summoned entities
- **Return Forcing**: Compelling conjured elements to return to their origin prematurely

## Musical Analogy

In the musical framework of magic, conjuration represents string instruments—creating connections that vibrate across distances, pulling disparate elements into harmony. The conjurer is like a harpist, plucking the strings that connect different points in the multiverse.

Conjuration spells are described in terms of "resonance" and "harmonics," with each successful manifestation requiring perfect tuning between the caster and target. Master conjurers can maintain complex "chords" of multiple connections simultaneously, drawing elements from various sources into carefully orchestrated combinations.
