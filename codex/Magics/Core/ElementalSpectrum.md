## Spectrum Overview

The Elemental Mana Spectrum represents the complete range of specialized mana types that can be derived from neutral [Base Mana](/codex/Magics/Core/BaseMana.md) through the process of [Mana Specialization](/codex/Magics/Core/ManaSpecialization.md). This spectrum follows specific patterns and relationships that determine how elemental energies interact, combine, and oppose one another. Understanding these relationships is essential for advanced spellcasting, particularly when working with multiple elements simultaneously.

### Visualization of the Spectrum

The Elemental Spectrum can be visualized in several ways:

1. **The Chromatic Circle**: A circular arrangement showing elemental transitions and oppositions
2. **The Harmonic Scale**: A linear representation emphasizing resonance relationships
3. **The Three-Dimensional Matrix**: A spatial model revealing complex interaction potentials
4. **The Wavelength Continuum**: A representation of elements as varying frequencies of Base Mana

Each visualization offers different insights into elemental relationships.

### The Specialization Gradient

The transition from Base Mana to fully specialized elemental forms is not binary but occurs along a gradient:

| Specialization Level | Base Mana Content | Elemental Character | Typical Application |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0% (Pure Base) | 100% | None | Structural foundations, force effects |
| 1-25% | 75-99% | Subtle influence | Gentle effects, broad-spectrum magic |
| 25-50% | 50-75% | Clear influence | Standard magical workings |
| 50-75% | 25-50% | Dominant character | Element-focused spellcasting |
| 75-90% | 10-25% | Very strong expression | Specialized elemental magic |
| 90-100% | 0-10% | Pure elemental form | Elemental manifestations, summonings |

This gradient explains why many spells require specific proportions of Base Mana and elemental types rather than pure forms.

## Primary Elements

The foundation of the elemental spectrum consists of ten primary elements, each representing fundamental aspects of reality:

### The Four Classical Elements

## Secondary Elements

Through the combination of primary elements, the following secondary elements emerge:

| Secondary Element | Component Elements | Mana Designation | Key Properties | Common Applications |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Lightning** | Fire + Air | Fulgumana | Sudden energy, conductivity | Electricity manipulation, rapid effects |

| **Wood** | Earth + Water | Lignimana | Growth, flexibility | Plant manipulation, organic structures |
| **Steam** | Water + Fire | Vapormana | Transformation, permeation | Purification, dispersion, cleansing |
| **Sand** | Earth + Air | Arenimana | Division, erosion | Abrasion, dispersion, shifting |
| **Crystal** | Earth + Light | Crystmana | Structure, amplification | Energy storage, resonance, clarity |
| **Mist** | Water + Shadow | Nebulmana | Obscuration, boundary blurring | Concealment, confusion, transition |
| **Sunlight** | Fire + Light | Solmana | Vivification, illumination | Growth acceleration, purification |
| **Moonlight** | Shadow + Light | Lunarmana | Reflection, subtle influence | Subtle transformations, divination |

## Tertiary Combinations

Complex combinations of three or more elements create tertiary forms with highly specialized applications:

| Tertiary Element | Component Elements | Properties | Applications |
|------------------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Storm** | Air + Water + Lightning | Chaotic energy, weather patterns | Weather manipulation, combined elemental force |
| **Magma** | Earth + Fire + Shadow | Destructive transformation, primordial force | Creation through destruction, fundamental change |
| **Spirit** | Life + Death + Aether | Consciousness, transcendence | Soul magic, consciousness manipulation |
| **Radiance** | Light + Fire + Life | Pure creative energy, divine essence | Healing, purification, manifestation |
| **Void** | Shadow + Death + Aether | Absence, negation, antimatter | Nullification, banishment, creating absolute emptiness |
| **Bloom** | Water + Earth + Life | Fertility, complex growth systems | Ecosystem creation, complex organic manipulation |

## Elemental Oppositions

Elements exist in oppositional pairs that create tension when combined:

### Primary Oppositions

| Element | Opposed By | Interaction Effect | Specialized Application |
|---------|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Fire | Water | Energy dampening, steam creation | Phase transition magic |
| Earth | Air | Force nullification, dust creation | Erosion and particulate magic |
| Light | Shadow | Visual neutralization, twilight creation | Boundary magic, transitions |
| Life | Death | Cycle regulation, transformation | Metamorphosis magic |
| Aether | Time | Space-time manipulation | Dimensional magic, temporal dilation |

### The Opposition Principle

When oppositional elements are combined:

1. **Energy Requirement**: Substantially higher mana requirement (typically 2-3× normal)
2. **Instability**: More difficult to maintain stable spell patterns
3. **Volatility**: Greater risk of spell failure or unintended effects
4. **Powerful Effects**: Successfully combining opposites creates powerful, specialized magic
5. **Neutralization**: At perfect balance, opposed elements can neutralize each other

## Elemental Resonance Frequencies

Each elemental type vibrates at specific frequencies derived from Base Mana:

| Element | Relative Frequency | Harmonic Character | Resonant Materials |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Base Mana | 1.0 (Reference) | Pure fundamental | Clear quartz, silver |
| Fire | 2.7-3.2 | Sharp, crackling | Ruby, brass, charcoal |
| Water | 0.3-0.7 | Flowing, soothing | Sapphire, copper, shells |
| Earth | 0.1-0.4 | Deep, steady | Emerald, iron, clay |
| Air | 1.8-2.2 | Light, variable | Opal, tin, feathers |
| Light | 3.0-3.5 | Bright, penetrating | Diamond, gold, mirror glass |
| Shadow | 0.2-0.5 | Muffled, absorbent | Onyx, lead, black velvet |
| Life | 1.2-1.6 | Pulsing, rhythmic | Amber, living wood, bone |
| Death | 0.4-0.8 | Slow, consuming | Jet, cold iron, ash |
| Time | 1.5-2.0 | Regular, precise | Amethyst, mercury, clockwork |
| Aether | 2.5-3.0 | Ethereal, distant | Celestite, platinum, void glass |

These frequencies explain why certain materials serve as better conduits for specific elemental magics.

## Practical Applications

### Elemental Balancing

The practical application of the elemental spectrum involves:

- **Spell Composition**: Selecting appropriate elemental ratios for desired effects
- **Opposition Management**: Techniques for working with opposed elements
- **Harmonic Spellcraft**: Creating spell patterns that leverage natural resonance
- **Conversion Efficiency**: Optimizing the specialization process for specific elements

### Spell Design Principles

1. **Elemental Core**: Identify the primary element most aligned with the desired effect
2. **Complementary Support**: Add supporting elements that enhance the primary effect
3. **Base Mana Framework**: Determine the appropriate Base Mana proportion for stability
4. **Opposition Avoidance**: Structure the spell to minimize oppositional interactions unless specifically required
5. **Resonance Optimization**: Adjust patterns to maximize natural harmonic relationships

### Elemental Affinities and Training

Most casters have natural affinities for certain elements and resistance to others. Training typically progresses in this sequence:

1. **Affinity Element**: Beginning with one's strongest natural elemental connection
2. **Adjacent Elements**: Moving to elements with harmonic compatibility
3. **Complementary Elements**: Learning elements that enhance one's affinity
4. **Neutral Elements**: Practicing with elements having neither strong affinity nor resistance
5. **Resistant Elements**: Gradually developing skill with difficult elements
6. **Opposed Elements**: Finally attempting one's natural opposition

## Conclusion

The Elemental Mana Spectrum represents one of the most fundamental organizing principles in magical theory. By understanding how Base Mana differentiates into specialized forms, how these forms relate to one another, and how they can be combined and manipulated, spellcasters gain access to the full range of magical possibilities. Whether creating simple single-element spells or complex multi-elemental workings, knowledge of the spectrum provides the theoretical foundation for effective spellcraft.
