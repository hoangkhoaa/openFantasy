## Overview

In OpenFantasy, mana purity determines spell effectiveness. While capacity indicates quantity, purity represents quality—the refinement of magical energy for precise spellcasting.

## Nature of Raw Mana

Raw mana, also known as [**Wild Mana**](/codex/Magics/WildMana.md), contains impurities that limit spellcasting effectiveness:

### Sources of Impurity

| Impurity Type | Description | Effect on Spellcasting |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Elemental Contaminants** | Environmental elements that cloud resonance | Disrupts complex patterns |
| **Emotional Imprints** | Caster's emotional state creates ripples | Competes with intentional patterns |
| **Resonance Dissonance** | Competing frequency patterns | Creates "static" interference |
| **Material Bonds** | Attachments to physical matter | Restricts flow and responsiveness |
| **Chaotic Fluctuations** | Random energy spikes and drops | Makes consistent casting impossible |

### Wild Mana Concentration Levels

The ambient concentration of Wild Mana varies by location:

| Environment | Concentration | Characteristics | Purification Difficulty |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Urban Centers** | Low to Moderate | Permeated with emotional imprints | Moderate (emotional filtering) |
| **Natural Wilderness** | Moderate | Balanced elemental presence | Standard |
| **Ley Line Confluence** | High | Intense but stable energy | Difficult (volume handling) |
| **Magical Anomalies** | Very High | Unpredictable, shifting energy | Extremely Difficult |
| **Wild Magic Zones** | Critical | Dangerous, reality-warping energy | Nearly Impossible |

## Wild Mana and Reality Shaping

The unpredictable and chaotic nature of Wild Mana serves an essential purpose in the magical ecosystem:

### Creative Force

Wild Mana constantly reshapes reality in subtle and occasionally dramatic ways:

- **Evolutionary Catalyst**: Drives magical adaptation in creatures and plants
- **Environmental Transformation**: Gradually alters landscapes over centuries
- **Spontaneous Generation**: Creates unique magical phenomena and creatures
- **Reality Flux**: Maintains flexibility in the fundamental laws of nature

> *"Without the chaos of Wild Mana, our world would be static, unchanging, and ultimately sterile. Its unpredictability is not a flaw—it is the heartbeat of creation itself."* — Archdruid Silvanus Wildroot

### Dangers of Direct Absorption

Attempting to absorb and use unfiltered Wild Mana carries significant risks:

| Exposure Level | Immediate Effects | Long-term Consequences |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Minor** | Spell instability, minor side effects | Temporary magical signature disruption |
| **Moderate** | Physical symptoms, erratic magical discharge | Lingering Wild Mana sensitivity |
| **Major** | Painful transformation, loss of casting control | Permanent magical signature alteration |
| **Critical** | Spontaneous wild magic effects, physical mutation | "Wild-touched" condition, uncontrollable magic |
| **Fatal** | Complete magical meltdown, reality warping | Death or transformation into wild magic entity |

**Warning Signs of Wild Mana Poisoning:**
- Iridescent mana glow visible beneath the skin
- Spontaneous minor magical effects when emotional
- Dreams that manifest physically upon waking
- Fluctuating magical resonance signature
- Physical changes reflecting elemental affinities

## Purification Process

Mages must master five key disciplines to achieve higher purity:

1. **Filtration** - Removing elemental contaminants
2. **Stabilization** - Neutralizing emotional influences
3. **Harmonic Alignment** - Eliminating frequency dissonance
4. **Liberation** - Breaking bonds with physical matter
5. **Equilibrium Maintenance** - Controlling energy fluctuations

## Purity Levels

### Visual and Tactile Characteristics

| Level | Range | Visual Appearance | Physical Sensation |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Crude** | 0-10% | Cloudy, murky with visible contaminants | Sluggish, resistant, "thick" |
| **Basic** | 10-35% | Slightly translucent with swirling impurities | Moderate resistance, "catches" |
| **Refined** | 35-65% | Clear with minimal disturbances | Smooth flow with minor friction |
| **Superior** | 65-85% | Crystal clear with harmonic patterns | Effortless flow, responsive |
| **Perfect** | 85-100% | Pristine clarity with perfect structure | Instantaneous response |

### Observable Effects of Impurity

- **Excess Discharge**: Energy leakage (sparkles/mist during casting)
- **Color Variations**: Fluctuations in magical effects
- **Sound Distortion**: Unintended sounds (crackling, humming)
- **Tactile Effects**: Tingling, heat, or pressure sensations

## Practical Applications

### Spell Requirements

- **Simple spells**: Function with 10-35% purity (less reliable)
- **Complex spells**: Require 35-65% purity
- **Master-level spells**: Demand 65%+ purity

### Consequences of Insufficient Purity

| Shortfall | Outcome | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Minor | **Diminished Effect** | Works with reduced effectiveness |
| Moderate | **Pattern Failure** | Spell never forms, wastes energy |
| Significant | **Unpredictable Result** | Forms incorrectly, unpredictable effects |
| Critical | **Magical Backlash** | Catastrophic collapse, potentially harmful |

### Water Purification Analogy

| Water Purity | Application | Mana Equivalent |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Muddy water | Basic irrigation | Crude (0-10%) |
| Filtered, untreated | Non-potable uses | Basic (10-35%) |
| Drinking water | Consumption | Refined (35-65%) |
| Laboratory-grade | Sensitive experiments | Superior (65-85%) |
| Ultra-pure | Semiconductor manufacturing | Perfect (85-100%) |

## Training and Aptitude

### Typical Progression

| Level | Training Period | Typical Purity |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Novice** | 0-2 years | 10-25% |
| **Journeyman** | 3-5 years | 25-45% |
| **Adept** | 5-10 years | 45-65% |
| **Master** | 10+ years | 65-85% |
| **Archmage** | 20+ years | 85%+ |

### Species Variations

- **Elves**: Natural harmonic alignment (purification advantage)
- **Dwarves**: Excel at stabilization but struggle with liberation
- **Humans**: Widest variation in natural ability
- **Fae**: Inherently pure mana but smaller capacities

## Enhancement Methods

Various methods can temporarily boost purity:

- **Focal objects** (crystals, wands, staffs)
- **Ritual preparations** (meditation, fasting)
- **Alchemical elixirs**
- **Environmental factors** (ley line convergences)
- **Enhancement buffs**

## Working with Spell Components

When casting a spell with specific mana type requirements:

1. **Draw** upon mana reserves
2. **Purify** to required threshold
3. **Separate** into required elemental types
4. **Weave** into spell pattern

> **Important**: The purity requirement applies to each mana type individually. If a spell requires 35% purity with multiple mana types, each type must be purified to at least 35%.
