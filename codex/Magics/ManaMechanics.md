## Overview

Mana mechanics govern how magical energy is gathered, stored, refined, and utilized within OpenFantasy. This document outlines the fundamental relationships between different aspects of mana manipulation.

## Two-Phase Mana Conversion Process

The foundation of all spellcasting lies in a two-phase conversion process that transforms environmental Wild Mana into usable magical energy:

### Phase 1: Wild Mana to Base Mana (Effectiveness-Focused)
- **Definition**: The biological process of absorbing Wild Mana from the environment and converting it to stable Base Mana within the caster's body
- **Key Metric**: Conversion Effectiveness (how efficiently Wild Mana becomes Base Mana)
- **Primary Bottleneck**: Mana Capacity (internal storage limitation)
- **Primary Function**: Creates the caster's internal magical reserves

> **Important Note**: All mana stored within living creatures is Base Mana. Wild Mana cannot be stored directly in biological systems without causing harm.

### Phase 2: Base Mana to Elemental Mana (Purity-Focused)
- **Definition**: The conscious, technical process of refining Base Mana into specialized Elemental Mana for spellcasting
- **Key Metric**: Purity Percentage (ratio of refined Elemental Mana to total energies used)
- **Primary Bottleneck**: Skill and technique (training-dependent)
- **Primary Function**: Creates specialized magical energy suitable for spellcasting

These two phases operate in sequence but require different skills and aptitudes, explaining why some casters may have large reserves but poor control, or vice versa.

## Mana Capacity and Spell Casting

Mana Capacity refers to the maximum amount of Base Mana a caster can store within their body after completing Phase 1 conversion. This capacity directly affects:

1. **Storage Capacity**: Total magical reserves available for Phase 2 conversion and spellcasting
2. **Regeneration Rate**: Speed at which depleted Base Mana is replenished through Phase 1 processes
3. **Casting Endurance**: Ability to sustain multiple spells or prolonged magical effects

### Capacity Levels and Effects

| Capacity Level | Base Mana Storage | Typical Regeneration | Maximum Spell Level | Representative Example |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Minimal (5-10%) | 5-10 units | 1 unit/hour | 1 | Average non-practitioner |
| Low (10-25%) | 10-25 units | 2 units/hour | 2 | Apprentice mage |
| Moderate (25-40%) | 25-40 units | 3-4 units/hour | 3 | Journeyman mage |
| High (40-60%) | 40-60 units | 5-6 units/hour | 4 | Master mage |
| Exceptional (60-80%) | 60-80 units | 7-9 units/hour | 5 | Archmage |
| Legendary (80-100%) | 80-100+ units | 10+ units/hour | 6+ | Once-in-a-generation talent |

> **Note on Measurement**: While "units" are used here for conceptual clarity, magical practitioners typically use more specialized terminology based on their tradition.

### Capacity's Impact on Maximum Achievable Purity

Mana Capacity indirectly affects Phase 2 conversion by providing more "working space" for refinement:

| Capacity Level | Maximum Achievable Purity | Reasoning |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Minimal (5-10%) | ~40% | Limited internal space creates pressure during refinement |
| Low (10-25%) | ~55% | Some pressure still affects fine control |
| Moderate (25-40%) | ~70% | Sufficient space for standard refinement techniques |
| High (40-60%) | ~85% | Ample space allows for intensive refinement |
| Exceptional (60-80%) | ~95% | Near-optimal conditions for purity |
| Legendary (80-100%) | 95%+ | Potential for theoretical "perfect" purity |

## Mana Purity and Spell Effectiveness

Mana Purity represents the quality of magical energy after Phase 2 conversion. It indicates how much of the energy has been successfully refined from Base Mana into the specific Elemental Mana required for a spell.

### Purity as a Percentage

Purity is calculated using the formula:
```
Purity % = (Refined Elemental Mana) / (Refined Elemental Mana + Residual Wild Mana) × 100%
```

### Purity Levels and Difficulty

| Purity Level | Percentage | Difficulty to Achieve | Typical Application |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Critical | 0-10% | Occurs with severe mistakes | Dangerous miscasts |
| Basic | 10-35% | Achievable by beginners | Simple utility spells |
| Standard | 35-65% | Requires formal training | Professional magic |
| Refined | 65-85% | Demands years of practice | Specialist applications |
| Perfect | 85-100% | Mastery level achievement | Highest magical arts |

Increasing purity beyond 90% requires exponentially more skill and effort, with diminishing practical returns in most applications.

## Spell Technical Requirements

All spells have technical requirements that determine their viability based on the caster's capabilities in both Phase 1 (Capacity) and Phase 2 (Purity) conversion.

### Mana Type Distribution

Spells require specific distributions of elemental energies:

| Spell Level | Fire | Water | Air | Earth | Arcane | Life | Void | Total |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|-------|--------|------|------|-------|
| Novice | 100% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 100% |
| Basic Dual | 60% | 40% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 100% |
| Complex | 40% | 30% | 20% | 10% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 100% |
| Advanced | 35% | 25% | 15% | 10% | 15% | 0% | 0% | 100% |
| Master | 25% | 20% | 15% | 10% | 20% | 5% | 5% | 100% |

This table represents a hypothetical fire-primary spell at different complexity levels.

### Minimum Purity Requirements

Each spell level has minimum purity requirements for stable casting:

| Spell Level | Minimum Purity | Optimal Purity | Effect of Low Purity |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Novice | 15% | 35%+ | Minor unpredictability |
| Apprentice | 25% | 45%+ | Reduced effectiveness |
| Journeyman | 35% | 55%+ | Significant instability |
| Adept | 45% | 65%+ | Potential backfire |
| Master | 55% | 75%+ | Dangerous failure |
| Archmage | 65% | 85%+ | Catastrophic consequences |

Casting below minimum purity is possible but increasingly hazardous with spell complexity.

### Minimum Capacity Requirements

Similarly, spells have minimum capacity thresholds:

| Spell Level | Min. Capacity | Optimal Capacity | Effect of Low Capacity |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Novice | 5% | 15%+ | Short duration |
| Apprentice | 15% | 25%+ | Quick exhaustion |
| Journeyman | 25% | 35%+ | Limited power |
| Adept | 35% | 45%+ | Single casting only |
| Master | 45% | 60%+ | Severe strain |
| Archmage | 60% | 75%+ | Potential burnout |

## The Harmony of Elements: A Musical Analogy

The relationship between Mana Capacity, Purity Level, and Spell Requirements can be understood through a musical analogy:

- **Phase 1 (Wild → Base) is like having an instrument**: A larger instrument (higher capacity) can produce more music for longer periods.
- **Phase 2 (Base → Elemental) is like playing technique**: Better technique (higher purity) produces clearer, more precise notes.
- **Spellcasting is like performing a composition**: Different pieces (spells) require both an adequate instrument and sufficient playing skill.

A virtuoso violinist (high purity, low capacity) might perfectly play short, complex pieces but lack endurance for longer performances. Conversely, a novice with a grand piano (high capacity, low purity) has potential for volume and duration but lacks the refinement for complex compositions.

## Training Progression

Magical development typically follows this progression:

### 1. Capacity Building (Phase 1 Focus)
- **Early Exercises**: Meditation, energy awareness, basic absorption techniques
- **Progression Markers**: Increased reserves, faster recovery after casting
- **Biological Changes**: Expansion of internal channels, increased metabolic efficiency
- **Typical Timeline**: Steady improvements over years of consistent practice

### 2. Purity Control Development (Phase 2 Focus)
- **Core Techniques**: Filtration exercises, elemental affinity development, pattern stability
- **Progression Markers**: Increased spell stability, reduced wild effects, finer control
- **Mental Development**: Enhanced visualization, improved concentration, pattern recognition
- **Typical Timeline**: Steep initial learning curve followed by plateau and breakthrough cycles

### 3. Balanced Mastery (Integrated Phase 1 and 2)
- **Advanced Methods**: Cyclical reinforcement, resonance harmonization, efficiency optimization
- **Progression Markers**: Ability to cast complex spells with minimal effort, adaptive casting
- **Holistic Changes**: Intuitive understanding of personal mana flow, environmental awareness
- **Typical Timeline**: Decades of dedicated practice with increasing returns on investment

## Individual Variations

Practitioners exhibit natural variations in their aptitude for the two conversion phases:

- **Capacity-Gifted**: Naturally high mana reserves but may struggle with refinement
- **Purity-Gifted**: Exceptional control and refinement but limited reserves
- **Balanced Aptitude**: Moderate natural talent in both aspects
- **Specialized Affinity**: Natural talent for specific elemental conversions
- **Adaptive Caster**: Ability to modify approach based on magical conditions

These natural tendencies are typically apparent by adolescence and influence recommended specialization paths.

*"Understanding the two phases of mana conversion is like understanding breathing and singing as separate skills. You may have massive lung capacity but poor vocal control, or perfect pitch but limited breath support. The master vocalist develops both in harmony, just as the master mage balances capacity and purity."* — Archmage Elendra Vos, Principal of the Royal Academy
