The OpenFantasy magic system is built on these core principles:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mana** | The fundamental magical energy that powers all spells |
| **Purity** | The refinement of mana, determining spell effectiveness |
| **Capacity** | The amount of mana a caster can hold and channel |
| **Resonance** | The harmonic properties of magical energies |
| **Pattern** | The structured form that shapes mana into specific effects |

## Magical Elements

The OpenFantasy world recognizes eight primary elements arranged in complementary pairs:

| Element | Opposed Element | Associated Mana |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Fire | Water | Pyromana |
| Water | Fire | Hydromana |
| Earth | Air | Terramana |
| Air | Earth | Aeromana |
| Light | Shadow | Luxmana |
| Shadow | Light | Umbramana |
| Life | Death | Vitaemana |
| Death | Life | Mortismana |

Base Mana serves as the foundation for all magical workings, with elemental mana types adding specific properties.

## Enhancement and Progression

Character advancement in magical ability follows several paths:

1. **Capacity Development**: Increasing the amount of mana a character can hold
2. **Purification Skill**: Improving the quality of mana a character can produce
3. **Pattern Complexity**: Learning more intricate spell structures
4. **Elemental Attunement**: Developing affinity with specific elements
5. **Specialization**: Focusing on particular magical disciplines

Enhancement buffs can temporarily boost these abilities beyond natural limits.

## Musical Framework

Magic in OpenFantasy is conceptualized through musical analogies:

- **Spellcasting** resembles playing a musical composition
- **Mana Purification** is like tuning an instrument
- **Multi-element magic** functions like chord progressions
- **Ritual magic** operates as a magical orchestra
- **Magical resonance** behaves according to harmonic principles

This thematic element reinforces the systematic nature of magic while providing intuitive understanding.
