## Overview

Bards weave magic through artistic expression, primarily music, creating harmonies that resonate with the fabric of reality itself. They are versatile spellcasters who blend performance, social finesse, and magical knowledge into a unique style of casting that can inspire allies, manipulate emotions, and harm enemies.
