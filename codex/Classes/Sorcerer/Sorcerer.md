# **Sorcerer**: Masters of Innate Magic

[**Sorcerers**](/codex/Classes/Sorcerer/Sorcerer.md) are individuals born with inherent magical abilities. Unlike wizards who study arcane formulas or warlocks who form pacts, sorcerers possess magic that manifests naturally from within, often connected to their bloodline or a significant mystical event.

## Elemental Composition

The typical elemental ratio for **sorcerers** represents their innate magical nature:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 25-40% | Physical vessel naturally attuned to channeling innate magic |
| **Soul** | 15-30% | Source of inherent magical potential, often linked to ancestry |
| **Mana Capacity** | 40-60% | Naturally occurring personal mana reserves that expand with experience |

This composition distinguishes **sorcerers** from other spellcasters. Their magic emerges instinctively rather than being learned or granted, with mana pathways that form naturally within their physical and spiritual being. The sorcerer's Exanthis component exhibits adaptations from birth that allow for safer channeling of their innate power.

### Magical Affinity Profile

Sorcerers develop specific affinities based on their magical origin:

| Origin Type | Primary Affinities | Secondary Affinities | Typical Application |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Draconic Bloodline** | Element matching ancestry | Base Mana (Protection) | Elemental damage, draconic resilience, intimidation |
| **Wild Magic** | Chaos Mana | Multiple Elements | Unpredictable effects, reality manipulation, spontaneous casting |
| **Divine Soul** | Luxmana | Base Mana (Healing) | Divine magic, healing, spiritual communion |
| **Shadow Magic** | Umbramana | Base Mana (Illusion) | Darkness manipulation, shadow conjuration, stealth |
| **Storm Sorcery** | Aeromana/Aquamana | Electromana | Weather control, lightning manipulation, flying |
| **Aberrant Mind** | Mentimana | Base Mana (Psychic) | Telepathy, mind control, psychic damage |

Sorcerers typically achieve 55-75% natural resonance with their primary affinity elements without formal training. Their innate connection allows for relatively high mana purity (30-50%) even without structured purification techniques, though this varies significantly between individuals based on natural talent and origin.

### Species-Specific Variations

Different species show varying natural inclinations toward the sorcerer class:

- **Humans** (25-40% Exanthis, 15-30% Soul, 40-60% Mana Capacity): Their adaptable nature allows for diverse sorcerous origins, though typically requiring a magical trigger or ancestral connection.
- **Dragonborn** (30-45% Exanthis, 15-25% Soul, 40-55% Mana Capacity): Their draconic heritage creates natural affinity for elemental magic matching their ancestry.
- **Gnomes** (20-35% Exanthis, 20-35% Soul, 40-60% Mana Capacity): Their innate connection to illusion magic often manifests as natural sorcerous ability.
- **Half-Elves** (25-35% Exanthis, 20-35% Soul, 40-55% Mana Capacity): Their mixed heritage can create unusual magical resonances and spontaneous sorcerous potential.
- **Tieflings** (25-40% Exanthis, 15-30% Soul, 45-65% Mana Capacity): Their infernal heritage often manifests as natural sorcerous ability, particularly with fire and darkness affinities.
