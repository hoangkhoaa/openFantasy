# **Rogue**: The Shadows of Subtlety

[**Rogues**](/codex/Classes/Rogue/Rogue.md) are the shadows of subtlety, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a subtle flute that moves unseen, they navigate the world with stealth and precision, creating a unique melody of existence that emphasizes agility, wit, and cunning.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Classes](/codex/Classes/Classes.md), the typical ratio for **rogues** forms a harmony that favors agility and perception:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 30-50% | The crystalline heart that provides moderate physical strength and exceptional agility |
| **Soul** | 30-50% | The ethereal essence that shapes a sharp and perceptive consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 10-30% | The bridge between worlds that enables limited magical potential |

This composition grants **rogues** their characteristic agility and perception but limits their magical abilities compared to other classes, like a nimble instrument that produces subtle sounds but cannot play powerful chords.

- **Humans** (35% Exanthis, 40% Soul, 25% Mana Capacity): Their adaptability allows them to excel in any rogue specialization, though they rarely reach the heights of species with more specialized compositions.
- **Dark Elves** (20% Exanthis, 40% Soul, 40% Mana Capacity): Their natural stealth and magical affinity make them powerful Assassins and Shadowblades.
- **Beastfolk** (45% Exanthis, 35% Soul, 20% Mana Capacity): Their physical prowess and enhanced senses make them natural Scouts and Hunters.
- **Dragonkin** (55% Exanthis, 25% Soul, 20% Mana Capacity): Their physical might makes them formidable Shadowblades, though their size can limit their stealth capabilities.
