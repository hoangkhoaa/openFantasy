# **Wizard**: Masters of Studied Arcana

[**Wizards**](/codex/Classes/Wizard/Wizard.md) are intellectual spellcasters who approach magic as a science to be understood, documented, and mastered through rigorous study and experimentation. Their power comes from comprehensive knowledge of arcane formulas and meticulous practice of magical techniques.

## Elemental Composition

The typical elemental ratio for **wizards** emphasizes their scholarly approach to magic:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 15-30% | Physical vessel trained to execute precise somatic components |
| **Soul** | 35-50% | Mental framework developed to comprehend and manipulate arcane patterns |
| **Mana Capacity** | 25-45% | Deliberately cultivated mana reserves with exceptional control systems |

This composition distinguishes **wizards** from other spellcasters through their emphasis on understanding over raw power. Wizards develop specialized neural and spiritual pathways through years of study, creating a refined system for interpreting and manipulating magical energy. Their physical forms adapt to support the cognitive demands of spellcasting rather than serving as primary channels.

### Magical Affinity Profile

Wizards develop specific affinities based on their school of specialization:

| School | Primary Affinities | Secondary Affinities | Typical Application |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Abjuration** | Base Mana (Protection) | Varies by application | Wards, barriers, banishment, dispelling |
| **Conjuration** | Base Mana (Creation) | Element matching creation | Summoning, teleportation, creation |
| **Divination** | Chronimana | Mentimana | Foresight, detection, information gathering |
| **Enchantment** | Mentimana | Base Mana (Influence) | Mind control, emotion manipulation, charm |
| **Evocation** | Various Elementals | Base Mana (Energy) | Elemental damage, force manipulation |
| **Illusion** | Base Mana (Sensory) | Mentimana | Visual/auditory deception, phantasms |
| **Necromancy** | Thanatomana | Base Mana (Vitality) | Animation, life force manipulation |
| **Transmutation** | Base Mana (Transformation) | Element matching target | Matter alteration, physical law manipulation |

Wizards typically achieve 40-60% resonance with their specialized school's elements, with decades of study potentially raising this to 70-85% in their areas of expertise. Their scholarly approach enables them to achieve high mana purity (45-65%) through disciplined purification techniques, with archmages reaching 75-90% purity in their specialized fields.

### Species-Specific Variations

Different species show varying natural inclinations toward the wizard class:

- **Humans** (15-30% Exanthis, 35-50% Soul, 25-45% Mana Capacity): Their adaptability allows for comprehensive magical study across multiple disciplines, with moderate specialization potential.
- **High Elves** (10-25% Exanthis, 40-55% Soul, 30-50% Mana Capacity): Their longevity and natural magical attunement creates exceptional retention of complex arcane formulas.
- **Gnomes** (15-25% Exanthis, 45-60% Soul, 20-40% Mana Capacity): Their innovative thinking creates natural affinity for illusion and transmutation magic.
- **Tieflings** (15-30% Exanthis, 35-50% Soul, 25-45% Mana Capacity): Their infernal heritage provides intuitive understanding of certain arcane concepts, particularly conjuration and evocation.
