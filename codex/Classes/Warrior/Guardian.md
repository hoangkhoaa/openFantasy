# **Guardian**: The Shield of the Innocent

[**Guardians**](/codex/Classes/Warrior/Guardian.md) are the defensive specialists of the [**Warrior**](/codex/Classes/Warrior/Warrior.md) class, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a protective barrier, they stand between danger and those they protect, creating a unique melody of existence that emphasizes defense, resilience, and sacrifice.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Classes](/codex/Classes/Classes.md), the typical ratio for **guardians** forms a harmony that favors defensive capabilities:

| Element | Percentage | Function |

| **Soul** | 20% | The ethereal essence that shapes a protective and selfless consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 15% | The bridge between worlds that enables limited protective magic |

This composition grants **guardians** their characteristic defensive prowess but limits their offensive capabilities compared to other warrior subclasses, like a shield that excels at blocking but cannot strike.

- Endure punishment that would incapacitate others, like a fortress that weathers the storm

This specialization makes **guardians** capable of achieving the highest levels of proficiency in defensive techniques, though they may struggle with tasks requiring offensive power or mobility, like a shield that excels at protection but cannot strike with the same force as a sword.

### Defensive Stance

The **Defensive Stance** technique allows guardians to adopt a posture that maximizes their defensive capabilities, like a fortress that stands ready to weather any storm. This technique reduces the guardian's mobility but significantly increases their ability to block and absorb attacks.
