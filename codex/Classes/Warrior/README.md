## Overview

Warriors are masters of physical combat, channeling their exceptional **Exanthis** to perform feats of strength and martial prowess. Like a powerful drum driving the rhythm of battle, they provide the foundation upon which armies are built and legends are forged.

## Class Composition

| Element | Typical Range | Function |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 50-70% | Physical prowess with exceptional strength and durability |
| **Soul** | 20-40% | Consciousness that enables tactical thinking and willpower |
| **Mana Capacity** | 5-15% | Limited magical potential but sufficient for combat enhancements |

This elemental balance grants warriors their characteristic physical might while limiting their magical capabilities.
