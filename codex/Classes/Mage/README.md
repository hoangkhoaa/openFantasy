## Overview

Mages are the weavers of arcane power, channeling their exceptional **Mana Capacity** to manipulate the fabric of reality through spellcasting. Like conductors orchestrating the elements, they shape magical energies with precision and purpose.

## Class Composition

|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 10-30% | Physical foundation with limited strength and durability |
| **Soul** | 20-40% | Consciousness that enables focused and analytical thinking |
