# **Mage**: The Weavers of Arcane Power

[**Mages**](/codex/Classes/Mage/Mage.md) are the weavers of arcane power, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a conductor orchestrating the elements, they shape reality through their command of [**Mana**](/codex/Basic/Mana.md), creating a unique melody of existence that emphasizes knowledge, power, and wisdom.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Classes](/codex/Classes/Classes.md), the typical ratio for **mages** forms a harmony that favors magical prowess:
