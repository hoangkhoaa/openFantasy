# **Warlock**: Wielders of Pact-Bound Magic

[**Warlocks**](/codex/Classes/Warlock/Warlock.md) are spellcasters who derive their magical abilities from pacts with powerful otherworldly entities. Unlike wizards who study or sorcerers with innate power, warlocks receive magic through direct patronage, shaping their abilities based on their patron's nature and domain.

## Elemental Composition

The typical elemental ratio for **warlocks** reflects their unique connection to patron entities:

| Element | Range | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Exanthis** | 15-30% | Physical vessel modified by patron influence |
| **Soul** | 30-45% | Spiritual anchor for the pact, reinforced to withstand external power |
| **Mana Capacity** | 30-50% | Channel structure for patron-sourced power rather than personal reserves |

This composition makes **warlocks** fundamentally different from other spellcasters. Their magic doesn't stem primarily from personal reserves but flows through specially adapted channels from their patron. This external sourcing creates distinctive magical signatures and often manifests physical or spiritual modifications reflecting their patron's nature.

### Magical Affinity Profile

Warlocks develop specific affinities based on their patron's nature:

| Patron Type | Primary Affinities | Secondary Affinities | Typical Application |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Archfey** | Naturemana | Mentimana | Enchantment, emotional manipulation, nature influence |
| **Fiend** | Pyromana | Umbramana | Destructive magic, soul manipulation, corruption |
| **Great Old One** | Mentimana | Umbramana | Mind-affecting spells, forbidden knowledge, reality distortion |
| **Celestial** | Luxmana | Base Mana (Healing) | Radiant damage, healing, purification |
| **Hexblade** | Umbramana | Base Mana (Binding) | Weapon enhancement, curses, soul binding |
| **Genie** | Elemental (varies by genie type) | Base Mana (Spatial) | Elemental control, wishes, dimensional magic |

Warlocks typically achieve 70-90% resonance with their patron's primary affinity elements, as these energies are directly channeled rather than personally generated. Their connection to patron sources allows for high purity magical energy (40-70%) without the extensive training required by wizards, though this power comes with external dependency and potential influence.

### Species-Specific Variations

Different species show varying natural inclinations toward the warlock class:

- **Humans** (15-30% Exanthis, 30-45% Soul, 30-50% Mana Capacity): Their adaptability allows for diverse pact connections and easier accommodation of patron influence.
- **Tieflings** (15-30% Exanthis, 35-50% Soul, 30-45% Mana Capacity): Their infernal heritage creates natural resonance with fiendish patrons and resistance to corrupting influences.
- **Half-Elves** (15-25% Exanthis, 30-45% Soul, 35-55% Mana Capacity): Their mixed heritage offers flexible spiritual anchoring for diverse pact types.
- **Aasimar** (15-25% Exanthis, 35-50% Soul, 30-45% Mana Capacity): Their celestial connection creates natural affinity for divine patrons with enhanced luxmana channeling.
- **Genasi** (20-35% Exanthis, 25-40% Soul, 30-50% Mana Capacity): Their elemental heritage forms natural channels for corresponding elemental patrons.
