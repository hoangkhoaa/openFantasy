# **Ranger**: The Voices of the Wild

[**Rangers**](/codex/Classes/Ranger/Ranger.md) are the voices of the wild, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a woodwind that echoes the sounds of the forest, they commune with nature, creating a unique melody of existence that emphasizes survival, tracking, and the connection to the natural world.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Classes](/codex/Classes/Classes.md), the typical ratio for **rangers** forms a harmony that favors connection to nature:

| Element | Range | Function |

| **Soul** | 25-45% | The ethereal essence that shapes a nature-connected consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 10-30% | The bridge between worlds that enables nature magic |

This composition grants **rangers** their characteristic connection to nature but limits their magical abilities compared to other classes, like a versatile instrument that can play many melodies but cannot match the complexity of a full orchestra.
