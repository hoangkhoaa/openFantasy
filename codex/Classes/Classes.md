## Class Progression

Classes in OpenFantasy follow a progression system that allows individuals to develop their abilities over time. This progression is represented by levels, each granting access to new abilities and powers, like a musician who learns increasingly complex pieces.

### Level Tiers

| Tier | Levels | Description |

| **Novice** | 1-5 | Beginners learning fundamentals |
| **Adept** | 6-10 | Masters of basics developing specialization |
| **Expert** | 11-15 | Specialists with highly honed abilities |
| **Master** | 16-20 | Those who have achieved true mastery |
| **Legendary** | 21+ | Individuals transcending normal limitations |

## Multiclassing

Some individuals choose to pursue multiple classes, combining abilities from different paths to create unique combinations. This practice, known as multiclassing, allows for greater versatility but may limit the depth of specialization in any single class, like a musician who plays multiple instruments but may not master any single one.

## Class-Species Interactions

Different species have natural affinities for certain classes based on their elemental composition:

| Species | Natural Class Affinities |
