# **Cleric**: The Bridges to the Divine

[**Clerics**](/codex/Classes/Cleric/Cleric.md) are the bridges to the divine, their bodies a harmonious blend of [**Exanthis**](/codex/Basic/Exanthis.md), [**Souls**](/codex/Basic/Soul.md), and **Mana Capacity**. Like a choir that bridges the mortal and divine, they commune with higher powers, creating a unique melody of existence that emphasizes faith, healing, and divine magic.

## Elemental Composition

As detailed in [Classes](/codex/Classes/Classes.md), the typical ratio for **clerics** forms a harmony that favors divine connection:

| **Soul** | 30-50% | The ethereal essence that shapes a faithful and devoted consciousness |
| **Mana Capacity** | 25-45% | The bridge between worlds that enables significant divine magic |

This composition grants **clerics** their characteristic divine connection but limits their physical capabilities compared to other classes, like a delicate instrument that produces beautiful harmonies but cannot withstand rough handling.
